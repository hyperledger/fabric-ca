# CA Deployment steps

## Download the binaries

The Fabric CA server and CA client binaries can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/releases). Scroll down to **Assets** and select the latest binary for your machine type. The .zip file contains both the CA server and the CA client binaries. After you have mastered deploying and running a CA by using these binaries, it is likely you will want to use the Fabric CA image instead, for example in a Kubernetes or Docker deployment. For now though, the purpose of this topic is to teach you how to properly use the binaries.

### Server binary file

In this topic, we use the server binaries to deploy three different types of CAs: the TLS CA, an organization CA, and optionally an intermediate CA. The TLS CA issues certificates that secure communicates between all the nodes in the organization. The organization CA issues identity certificates. If you decide to include an intermediate CA, the organization CA serves as the root CA or parent server for the intermediate CA. If you have not already, you should review the topic on [Planning for a CA](ca-deploy-topology.html) to understand the purpose of each type of CA and their differences. We run the TLS CA, organization CA, and intermediate CAs from different folders. We will copy the CA server binary to each folder.

### Client binary file

Likewise, we will copy the Fabric CA client binary to its own directory. Having the CA client in its own folder facilitates certificate management, especially when you need to interact with multiple CAs.  When you issue a command from the CA client against a CA server, you can target a specific CA by modifying the CA server URL on the request. Therefore, only a single Fabric CA client binary is required and can be used to transact with multiple CAs. More on using the Fabric CA client below.

## Fabric CA client

Before deploying a Fabric CA server, you need to understand the role of the Fabric CA client. While you can use the Fabric SDKs to interact with your CA, it is recommended that you **use the Fabric CA client to register and enroll node admin identities**. The instructions provided in this topic assume a single Fabric CA client is being used. Registering an identity, or user, is the process by which the enroll id and secret is added to the CA database "user registry". If you are using LDAP server for your user registry, then the register step is not required because the identities already exist in the LDAP database. After a user is registered you can use the Fabric CA client to "enroll" the identity which is the process that generates the certificates the identity needs to transact as part of the organization. When you submit an enrollment request, the private and public keys are first generated locally by the Fabric CA client, and then the public key is sent to the CA which returns an encoded "signed certificate".

Because you will use a single CA client to submit register and enrollment requests to multiple CAs, certificate management is critically important when using the CA client.  A best practice therefore is to create sub-folders for each CA server that the CA client will interact with, to store the generated certificates.

- Create a sub-folder in order to connect to each CA server, such as `/tls-ca` or `/org1-ca` or `/int-ca`. This folder can be under the Fabric CA client or anywhere that the CA client can access the path. For purposes of these instructions, these folders reside inside the `fabric-ca-client` directory. For example:

  ```
  mkdir fabric-ca-client
  cd fabric-ca-client
  mkdir tls-ca org1-ca int-ca
  ```
  **Tip:** While you can run the Fabric CA client binary from any folder you prefer, for ease of following these instructions we will refer to it in its own directory named `fabric-ca-client`.
- Copy the Fabric CA client binary into the `fabric-ca-client` folder.
- Because TLS communications are enabled on a production network, the TLS CA for the organization is responsible for generating certificates that secure communications between all nodes in the organization. Therefore, every time the Fabric CA client transacts with a CA server in that organization, it needs to provide the TLS CA "root certificate" to secure the client-server communication. For example, when the Fabric CA client issues a register or enroll request to the CA server, the client request includes that root certificate to perform an SSL handshake.  The TLS CA root certificate, named `ca-cert.pem`, is generated on the TLS CA after TLS is enabled in the server config .yaml file. To enable TLS communications for your CA client, you need a `tls-root-cert` sub-folder to store the root certificate. Later in this topic, we will copy the root certificate into this folder.  

  ```
  mkdir tls-root-cert
  ```

  The resulting folder structure resembles:
    ```
    fabric-ca-client
      ├── int-ca
      ├── org1-ca
      ├── tls-ca
      └── tls-root-cert

    ```      

**Important:** If your Fabric CA client will transact with CAs from multiple organizations that are secured by different TLS servers, then you would need to either create different `tls-root-cert` folders to hold the TLS CA root certificate for each organization or simply name them differently inside the folder to differentiate them. Since our Fabric CA client will only be transacting with CA servers in the same organization, all of which are secured by the same TLS CA, we will only have a single root certificate in this folder.

You can use environment variables or flags on the CLI commands to specify the location of certificates and the Fabric CA client binary:
- `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME` - Specify the fully qualified path to where Fabric CA client binary resides.
- `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES` - Specify the location and name of the TLS CA root certificate. If the path of the environment variable `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES` is not an absolute path, it will be parsed as relative to the Fabric CA client’s home directory as specified by `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME`. Throughout these instructions, we use the `--tls.certfiles` flag on the commands instead to specify the location of the TLS CA root certificate.
- `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR` - While you can use this environment variable to specify the name of the folder where the certificates are located, because the client communicates with multiple CAs, _a better option is to explicitly pass the `--mspdir` flag on the register and enroll commands to specify the location._ If not specified on the command, the location defaults to `$FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME/msp` which will be problematic if the Fabric CA client transacts with multiple CA servers in the organization.

**Tip:** The first time you issue an `enroll` command from the CA client, if the `fabric-ca-client-config.yaml` does not already exist in the `$FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME` directory, it is generated. When you customize the values in this file, they are used automatically by the CA client and do not have to be passed on the command line on a subsequent `enroll` command.

The usage of a single Fabric CA client to interact with multiple CA servers is used throughout these instructions but is not necessarily a required pattern. Another alternative is to have a single Fabric CA client for _each_ CA server. In that case, the Fabric CA client connection settings to the server are generated and stored in the `fabric-ca-client-config.yaml` file when the initial enroll command is issued for the CA server admin.

## Submitting transactions from the CLI

Two sets of CLI commands are included with the CA server and CA client binary files:

- Use the [Fabric CA **server** CLI commands](../servercli.html) to deploy and update the CA server.

- Use the [Fabric CA **client** CLI commands ](../clientcli.html) to submit requests to your CA server after it is set up, such as registering, enrolling or revoking identities.

We will use both of these CLI commands throughout this topic.

## What order should I deploy the CAs?

Assuming you are not deploying a dual-headed CA that contains both a TLS CA and an organization CA together, you would deploy the CAs in the following order:
1. **Deploy the TLS CA**  

    Because TLS communication is required in a Production network, TLS must be enabled on each CA, peer, and ordering node. While the example configuration in the CA Operations Guide shares a single TLS CA across all organizations, the recommended configuration for production is to deploy a TLS CA for each organization. The TLS CA issues the TLS certificates that secure communications between all the nodes on the network. Therefore, it needs to be deployed first to generate the TLS certificates for the TLS handshake that occurs between the nodes.

2. **Deploy the organization CA**  

    This is the organization's identity enrollment CA and is used to register and enroll the identities that will participate in the network from this organization.

3. **Deploy the intermediate CA (Optional)**  

    If you decide to include an intermediate CA in your network, the intermediate CA's parent server (the associated root CA) must be deployed before any intermediate CAs.

## Deploy the TLS CA

Regardless of whether you are setting up a TLS CA, an organization CA or an intermediate CA, the process follows the same overall steps. The differences will be in the modifications you make to the CA server configuration .yaml file. The following steps provide an overview of the process:

- [Step one: Initialize the CA server](#initialize-the-tls-ca-server)
- [Step two: Modify the CA server configuration](#modify-the-tls-ca-server-configuration)
- [Step three: Delete the CA server certificates](#delete-the-tls-ca-server-certificates)
- [Step four: Start the CA server](#start-the-tls-ca-server)
- [Step five: Enroll bootstrap user with TLS CA](#enroll-bootstrap-user-with-tls-ca)

When you deploy any node, you have three options for your TLS configuration:
- No TLS. _Not recommended for a production network._
- Server-side TLS.
- Mutual TLS.

This process will configure a CA with server-side TLS enabled which is recommended for production networks. Mutual TLS is disabled by default. If you need to use mutual TLS, refer to the [TLS configuration settings](ca-config.html#tls).

### Before you begin

You should have already downloaded and copied the Fabric CA server binary `fabric-ca-server` to a clean directory on your machine. For purposes of these instructions, we put the binary in its own folder named `fabric-ca-server-tls`.

  ```
  mkdir fabric-ca-server-tls
  ```
  Copy the `fabric-ca-server` binary into this folder.

### Initialize the TLS CA server

The first step to deploy a CA server is to "initialize" it. Run the following CA server CLI command to initialize the server by specifying the admin user id and password for the CA:

```
./fabric-ca-server init -b <ADMIN_USER>:<ADMIN_PWD>
```

For example:
```
cd fabric-ca-server-tls
./fabric-ca-server init -b tls-admin:tls-adminpw
```
The `-b` (bootstrap identity) flag bootstraps the admin username and password to the CA server which effectively "registers" the CA admin user with the server for you, so an explicit Fabric CA client CLI `register` command is not required for the bootstrapped user.  All CA users need to be "registered" and then "enrolled" with the CA, except for this CA admin identity which is implicitly registered by using the `-b` flag. The registration process inserts the user into the CA database. The `-b` option is not required for initialization when LDAP will be configured.

**Note: This example is for illustration purposes only. Obviously, in a production environment you would never use `tls-admin` and `tls-adminpw` as the bootstrap username and password.**  Be sure that you record the admin id and password that you specify. They are required later when you issue register and enroll commands against the CA. It can help to use a meaningful id to differentiate which server you are transacting with and follow secure password practices.  

#### What does the CA server `init` command do?

The `init` command does not actually start the server but generates the required metadata if it does not already exist for the server:
- Sets the default the CA Home directory (referred to as `FABRIC_CA_HOME` in these instructions) to where the `fabric-ca-server init` command is run.
- Generates the default configuration file `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml` that is used as a template for your server configuration in the `FABRIC_CA_HOME` directory. We refer to this file throughout these instructions as the "configuration .yaml" file.
- Creates the TLS CA root signed certificate file `ca-cert.pem`, if it does not already exist in the CA Home directory. This is the **self-signed root certificate**, meaning it is generated and signed by the TLS CA itself and does not come from another source. This certificate is the public key that must be shared with all clients that want to transact with any node in the organization. When any client or node submits a transaction to another node, it must include this certificate as part of the transaction.
- Generates the CA server private key and stores it in the `FABRIC_CA_HOME` directory under `/msp/keystore`.
- Initializes a default SQLite database for the server although you can modify the database setting in the configuration .yaml file to use the supported database of your choice. Every time the server is started, it loads the data from this database. If you later switch to a different database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, and the identities defined in the `registry.identites` section of the configuration .yaml file don’t exist in that database, they will be registered.
- Bootstraps the CA server administrator, specified by the `-b` flag parameters `<ADMIN_USER>` and `<ADMIN_PWD>`, onto the server. When the CA server is subsequently started, the admin user is registered with the admin attributes provided in the configuration .yaml file `registry` section. If this CA will be used to register other users with any of those attributes, then the CA admin user needs to possess those attributes. In other words, the registrar must have the `hf.Registrar.Roles` attributes before it can register another identity with any of those attributes. Therefore, if this CA admin will be used to register the admin identity for an Intermediate CA, then this CA admin must have the `hf.IntermediateCA` set to `true` even though this may not be an intermediate CA server. The default settings already include these attributes.

**Important**: When you modify settings in the configuration .yaml file and restart the server, the **previously issued certificates are not replaced**. If you want the certificates to be regenerated when the server is started, you need to delete them and run the `fabric-ca-server start` command. For example, if you modify the `csr` values after you start the server, you need to delete the previously generated certificates, and then run the `fabric-ca-server start` command. Be aware though, that when you restart the CA server using the new signed certificate and private key, all previously issued certificates will no longer be able to authenticate with the CA.

### Modify the TLS CA server configuration

Now that you have initialized your server, you can edit the generated `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml` file to modify the default configuration settings for your use case according to the [Checklist for a production CA server](ca-config.html).

At a minimum you should do the following:
- `port` - Enter the port that you want to use for this server. These instructions use `7054`, but you can choose your port.
- `tls.enabled` - Recall that TLS is disabled in the default configuration file. Since this is a production server, enable it by setting this value to `true`. Setting this value to `true` causes the TLS signed certificate `tls-cert.pem` file to be generated when the server is started in the next step. The `tls-cert.pem` is the certificate the server will present to the client during a TLS handshake, which the client will then verify using the TLS CA’s `ca-cert.pem`.
- `ca.name` - Give the CA a name by editing the parameter, for example `tls-ca`.
- `csr.hosts` - Update this parameter to include this hostname and ip address where this server is running, if it is different than what is already in this file.
- `signing.profiles.ca` - Since this is a TLS CA that will not issue CA certificates, the `ca` profiles section can be removed. The `signing.profiles` block should only contain `tls` profile.
- `operations.listenAddress:` -  In the unlikely case that there is another node running on this host and port, then you need to update this parameter to use a different port.

### Delete the TLS CA server certificates

Before starting the server, if you modified any of the values in the `csr` block of the configuration .yaml file, you need to delete the `fabric-ca-server-tls/ca-cert.pem` file and the entire `fabric-ca-server-tls/msp` folder. These certificates will be re-generated when you start the CA server in the next step.

### Start the TLS CA server

Run the following command to start the CA server:
```
./fabric-ca-server start
```
When the server starts successfully you will see something similar to:
```
[INFO] Listening on https://0.0.0.0:7054
```
Because you have enabled TLS communications, notice that the TLS signed certificate `tls-cert.pem` file is generated under the `FABRIC_CA_HOME` location.

**Tip:** The CA `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PWD` that were set on the `init` command cannot be overridden with the `-b` flag on this `start` command. When you need to modify the CA admin password, use the Fabric CA client [identity](../clientcli.html#identity-command) command.

**Optional flags**:
- `-d` - If you want to run the server in DEBUG mode which facilitates problem diagnosis, you can include the `-d` flag on the start command. However, in general it is not recommended to run a server with debug enabled as this will cause the server to perform slower.
- `-p` - If you want the server to run on a port different than what is specified in the configuration .yaml file, you can override the existing port.

### Enroll bootstrap user with TLS CA

Now that your TLS CA is configured and before you can deploy any other nodes for your organization, you need to enroll the bootstrap (admin) user of the TLS CA. Since the CA server is up and running, instead of using the **Fabric CA server CLI commands** we now use the **Fabric CA client CLI commands** to submit an enrollment request to the server.

Performed by using the Fabric CA client, the enrollment process is used to generate the certificate and private key pair which forms the node identity. You should have already setup the required folders in the [Fabric CA client](#fabric-ca-client) section.

The folder structure that we are using for these Fabric CA client commands is:
  ```
  fabric-ca-client
    └── tls-ca
    └── tls-root-cert
  ```
  These folders are used by the Fabric CA client to:
   - Store the certificates that are issued when the Fabric CA client enroll command is run against the TLS CA server to enroll the TLS CA bootstrap identity. (**tls-ca** folder)
   - Know where the TLS CA root certificate resides that allows the Fabric CA client to communicate with the TLS CA server. (**tls-root-cert** folder)

1. Copy the TLS CA root certificate file `fabric-ca-server-tls/ca-cert.pem`, that was generated when the TLS CA server was started, to the `fabric-ca-client/tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem` folder. Notice the file name is changed to `tls-ca-cert.pem` to make it clear this is the root certificate from the TLS CA. **Important:** This TLS CA root certificate will need to be available on each client system that will run commands against the TLS CA.

2. The Fabric CA Client also needs to know where Fabric CA client binary is located. The `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME` environment variable is used to set the location.

   ```
   export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=<FULLY-QUALIFIED-PATH-TO-FABRIC-CA-BINARY>
   ```
   For example, if you are in the `fabric-ca-client` folder you can use:
   ```
   export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$PWD
   ```
3. You are ready to use the Fabric CA client CLI to enroll the TLS CA admin user. Run the command:
   ```
   ./fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://<ADMIN>:<ADMIN-PWD>@<CA-URL>:<PORT> --tls.certfiles <RELATIVE-PATH-TO-TLS-CERT> --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts '<CA_HOSTNAME>' --mspdir tls-ca/tlsadmin/msp
   ```
   Replace:
   - `<ADMIN>` - with the TLS CA admin specified on the `init` command.
   - `<ADMIN-PWD>` - with the TLS CA admin password specified on the `init` command.
   - `<CA-URL>` - with the hostname specified in the `csr` section of the TLS CA configuration .yaml file.
   - `<PORT>` - with the port that the TLS CA is listening on.
   - `<RELATIVE-PATH-TO-TLS-CERT>` - with the path and name of the root TLS certificate file that you copied from your TLS CA. This path is relative to `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME`. If you are following the folder structure in this tutorial it would be `tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem`.
   - `<CA_HOSTNAME>` - with a comma-separated list of host names for which the certificate should be valid. If not specified, the default value from the `fabric-ca-client-config.yaml` is used. You can specify a wildcard for the domain. For example, when you include the flag `--csr.hosts 'host1,*.example.com'` it means that the hostname `host1` is recognized as well as any host from the `example.com` domain. These values are inserted into the generated certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) attribute. The value specified here corresponds to the `csr.hosts` parameter that you specified for the CA server.

   For example:
   ```
   ./fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://tls-admin:tls-adminpw@my-machine.example.com:7054 --tls.certfiles tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts 'host1,*.example.com' --mspdir tls-ca/tlsadmin/msp
   ```

   In this case, the `-d` parameter runs the client in DEBUG mode which is useful for debugging enrollment failures.

   Notice the `--mspdir` flag is used on the command to designate where to store the TLS CA admin certificates that are generated by the enroll command.

   The `--enrollment.profile tls` flag is specified because we are enrolling against the TLS CA. Use of this flag means that the enrollment is performed according to the `usage` and `expiry` settings of the TLS profile that is defined in the `signing` section of the configuration .yaml file. **Note:** If you removed the `signing.profiles.ca` block from the TLS CA configuration .yaml file, you could omit the `--enrollment.profile tls` flag.

   When this command completes successfully, the `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/tlsadmin/msp` folder is generated and contains the signed cert and private key for the TLS CA admin identity. If the enroll command fails for some reason, to avoid confusion later, you should remove the generated private key from the `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/admin/msp/keystore` folder before reattempting the enroll command. We will reference this crypto material later when it is required to register other identities with the TLS CA.

   **Tip:** After you issue this first `enroll` command from the Fabric CA client, examine the contents of the generated  `fabric-ca-client/fabric-ca-client-config.yaml` file to become familiar with the default settings that are used by the Fabric CA client. Because we are using a single Fabric CA client to interact with multiple CA servers, we need to use the `-u` flags on the client CLI commands to target the correct CA server. In conjunction, the `--mspdir` flag indicates the location of the cryptographic material to use on a `register` command or where to store the generated certificates on an `enroll` command.

The following diagram is a conceptual summary of the steps you perform to create a TLS CA server and enroll the bootstrap identity using the Fabric CA client:

![ca-tls-flow](./ca-tls-flow.png)

### Register and enroll the organization CA bootstrap identity with the TLS CA

The TLS CA server was started with a bootstrap identity which has full admin privileges for the server. One of the key abilities of the admin is the ability to register new identities. Each node in the organization that transacts on the network needs to register with the TLS CA. Therefore, before we set up the organization CA, we need to use the TLS CA to register and enroll the organization CA bootstrap identity to get its TLS certificate and private key.  The following command registers the organization CA bootstrap identity `rcaadmin` and `rcaadminpw` with the TLS CA.

```
./fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name rcaadmin --id.secret rcaadminpw -u https://my-machine.example.com:7054  --tls.certfiles tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem --mspdir tls-ca/tlsadmin/msp
```

Notice that the `--mspdir` flag on the command points to the location of TLS CA admin msp certificates that we generated in the previous step. This crypto material is required to be able to register other users with the TLS CA.

Next, we need to enroll the `rcaadmin` user to generate the TLS certificates for the identity. In this case, we use the `--mspdir` flag on the enroll command to designate where the generated organization CA TLS certificates should be stored for the `rcaadmin` user. Because these certificates are for a different identity, it is a best practice to put them in their own folder. Therefore, instead of generating them in the default `msp` folder, we will put them in a new folder named `rcaadmin` that resides along side the `tlsadmin` folder.

```
./fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://rcaadmin:rcaadminpw@my-machine.example.com:7054 --tls.certfiles tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts 'host1,*.example.com' --mspdir tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp
```

In this case, the `--mspdir` flag works a little differently. For the enroll command, the `--mspdir` flag indicates where to store the generated certificates for the `rcaadmin` identity.

**Important:** The organization CA TLS signed certificate is generated under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/signcert` and the private key is available under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/keystore`. When you deploy the organization CA you will need to point to the location of these two files in the `tls` section of the CA configuration .yaml file. For ease of reference, you can rename the file in the `keystore` folder to `key.pem`.

### (Optional) Register and enroll the Intermediate CA admin with the TLS CA

Similarly, if you are planning to have an intermediate CA that can issue certificates on behalf of the organization CA, you should also register and enroll the intermediate CA admin user now as well. The following command registers the intermediate CA admin id `icaadmin` and `icaadminpw` with the TLS CA. You can use any values you choose for the identity name and password.

```
./fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name icaadmin --id.secret icaadminpw -u https://my-machine.example.com:7054  --tls.certfiles tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem --mspdir tls-ca/tlsadmin/msp
```

Again, the `--mspdir` flag on the register command points to the location of TLS CA admin msp certificates that are required to be able to register other users with the TLS CA.

Now would also be a good time to generate the intermediate CA TLS certificates for the `icaadmin` user by enrolling the user. For the enroll command, we use the `--mspdir` flag to designate where the generated intermediate CA TLS certificates should be stored for the `icaadmin` user. In this case we put them into a new folder named `icaadmin/msp` along side the `tlsadmin` folder.

```
./fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://icaadmin:icaadminpw@my-machine.example.com:7054 --tls.certfiles tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts 'host1,*.example.com' --mspdir tls-ca/icaadmin/msp
```

**Important:** The intermediate CA TLS signed certificate is generated under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/signcert` and the private key is available under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/keystore`. When you deploy the intermediate CA you will need to refer to these two files in the `tls` section of the intermediate CA configuration .yaml file. For ease of reference you can rename the file in the `keystore` folder to `key.pem`.

The resulting folder structure resembles:

```
fabric-ca-client
  └── tls-ca
    └── tlsadmin
      └── msp
    └── rcaadmin
      └── msp
    └── icaadmin
      └── msp
    └── tls-root-cert
      └── tls-ca-cert.pem
```

**Tip:** After you have registered all your nodes with the TLS CA, it can be safely turned off.

## Deploy an organization CA

The deployment process overview describes the need for both an organization CA and a TLS CA for every organization. The TLS CA issues the TLS certificates that allow for secure transactions within the organization. The organization CA, also referred to as the "enrollment CA" or the "eCert CA" is used to issue identities for the organization. You deployed the TLS CA in the previous set of steps, now we are ready to deploy the organization CA. Later in this topic you can optionally create an intermediate CA; therefore, this CA serves as the "root CA" in that chain of trust.

Because you've already registered and enrolled your organization CA bootstrap identity `rcaadmin` with the TLS CA in the previous step, you are ready to deploy the CA following the same pattern of steps that were used when you deployed the TLS CA.

### Before you begin

- Copy the Fabric CA server binary `fabric-ca-server` to a new directory on your machine. For purposes of these instructions, we put the binary in its own folder named `fabric-ca-server-org1`.
  ```
  mkdir fabric-ca-server-org1
  ```
  Now, copy the `fabric-ca-server` binary into this folder.
- Using the following commands, copy the organization CA TLS certificate and key pair that you generated in the previous step to a location that can be accessed by this CA server, for example `fabric-ca-server-org1/tls`. These are the `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem` and `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/keystore/` files that were generated by the enroll command.

  **Note:** The following commands assume that:
  - The generated private key under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/keystore/` was renamed to `key.pem`.
  - The `fabric-ca-client` and `fabric-ca-server-org1` folders are at the same level in your file structure.

  ```
  cd fabric-ca-server-org1
  mkdir tls
  cp ../fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem tls && cp ../fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/keystore/key.pem tls
  ```
  The resulting folder structure is similar to the following diagram. (Some folders and files have been omitted for clarity):
    ```
    fabric-ca-client
      └── tls-ca
            ├── rcaadmin
              ├── msp
                 ├── IssuerPublicKey
                 ├── IssuerRevocationPublicKey
                 ├── cacerts
                 ├── keystore
                     └── key.pem
                 ├── signcerts
                     └── cert.pem
    fabric-ca-server-org1
      └── tls
        └── cert.pem
        └── key.pem
    ```

### Initialize the CA server

Run the command to initialize the server, specifying a new admin user id and password for the CA. We use the same identity `rcaadmin` that we registered with the TLS CA in the previous set of steps as the bootstrap identity of the organization CA. Run this command from the `fabric-ca-server-org1` folder.

```
./fabric-ca-server init -b <ADMIN_USER>:<ADMIN_PWD>
```

For example:
```
./fabric-ca-server init -b rcaadmin:rcaadminpw

### Modify the CA server configuration

As we did with the TLS CA, we need to edit the generated `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml` file for the organization CA to modify the default configuration settings for your use case according to the [Checklist for a production CA server](ca-config.html).

At a minimum, you should edit the following fields:
- `port` - Enter the port that you want to use for this server. These instructions use `7055`, but you can choose your port.
- `tls.enabled` - Enable TLS by setting this value to `true`.
- `tls.certfile` and `tls.keystore`- Enter the relative path and filenames for the TLS CA signed certificate and private key that were generated when the bootstrap admin for this CA was enrolled with the TLS CA. The signed certificate, `cert.pem`, was generated using the Fabric CA client and can be found under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem`. The private key is located under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/rcaadmin/msp/keystore`. The specified path name is relative to `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME` therefore if you are following the folder structure that is used throughout these instructions you can simply specify `tls/cert.pem` for the `tls.certfile` and `tls/key.pem` for the `tls.keystore` or you can specify the fully qualified path name.
- `ca.name` - Give the organization CA a name by specifying a value in this parameter, for example `org1-ca`.
- `csr.hosts` - Update this parameter to include this hostname and ip address where this server is running if it is different than what is already in the file.
- `operations.listenAddress:` - If there is another CA running on this host, then you need to update this parameter to use a different port.
- `csr.ca.pathlength`: This field is used to limit CA certificate hierarchy. Setting this value to `1` for the root CA means the root CA can issue intermediate CA certificates, but these intermediate CAs cannot in turn issue other **CA** certificates. In other words the intermediate CA cannot enroll other intermediate CAs, but it can issue enrollment certificates for users. The default value is `1`.
- `signing.profiles.ca.caconstraint.maxpathlen` - This field represents the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that can follow this certificate in a certificate chain. **If this will be a parent server for an intermediate CA, and you want that intermediate CA to act as a parent CA for another intermediate CA, this root CA needs to set this value to greater than 0 in the configuration .yaml file.** See the instructions for the [signing](ca-config.html#signing) section. The default value is `0`.
- `operations.listenAddress:` -  In the unlikely case that there is another node running on this host and port, then you need to update this parameter to use a different port.

### Delete the CA server certificates

Before starting the server, if you modified any of the values in the `csr` block of the configuration .yaml file, you need to delete the `fabric-ca-server-org1/ca-cert.pem` file and the entire `fabric-ca-server-org1/msp` folder. These certificates will be re-generated based on the new settings in the configuration .yaml file when you start the CA server in the next step.

### Start the CA server

Run the following command to start the CA server:
```
./fabric-ca-server start
```

### Enroll the CA admin

The final step for deploying the CA is to enroll the CA admin bootstrap identity which generates the node signed certificate and private key. The key-pair is required for this admin identity to be able to enroll other identities. Again we will use the Fabric CA client CLI to enroll the admin. You should have already setup the required folders in the [Fabric CA client](#fabric-ca-client) section.

The folder structure we are using for these commands is:
  ```
  fabric-ca-client
    └── org1-ca
    └── tls-root-cert
  ```
  These folders are used by the Fabric CA client to:
   - Store the certificates that are issued when the Fabric CA client enroll command is run against the TLS CA server. (**org1-ca** folder)
   -  Know where the TLS certificate resides that allows the Fabric CA client to communicate with the TLS CA server. (**tls-root-cert** folder)


1. When you previously used the Fabric CA client to generate certificates for the TLS CA, you designated the value of the `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME`. Assuming that is still set you can proceed to the next step. Otherwise, you should be in the directory where the Fabric CA client binary resides and run the command:

    ```
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$PWD
    ```

2. Now you can use the Fabric CA client to generate the CA admin certificate and private key. You need this certificate and private key to be able to issue identities using this CA. We use the `--mspdir` flag on the enroll command to designate where to store the generated certificates. Run the command:
   ```
   ./fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://<ADMIN>:<ADMIN-PWD>@<CA-URL>:<PORT> --tls.certfiles <RELATIVE-PATH-TO-TLS-CERT> --csr.hosts '<CA_HOSTNAME>' --mspdir org1-ca/rcaadmin/msp
   ```
   Replace:
   - `<ADMIN>` - with the organization CA admin specified on the `init` command.
   - `<ADMIN-PWD>` - with the organization CA admin password specified on the `init` command.
   - `<CA-URL>` - with the hostname specified in the `csr` section of the organization CA configuration .yaml file.
   - `<PORT>` - with the port that the organization CA is listening on.
   - `<RELATIVE-PATH-TO-TLS-CERT>` - with the path to the tls-ca-cert.pem file that you copied from your TLS CA. This is the path relative to `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME`.
   - `<CA_HOSTNAME>` - with a comma-separated list of host names for which the certificate should be valid. If not specified, the default value from the `fabric-ca-client-config.yaml` is used. If a host name is dynamic you can specify a wildcard for the domain. For example, when you include the flag `--csr.hosts 'host1,*.example.com'` it means that the hostname `host1` is recognized as well as any host from the `example.com` domain.

   In this case, the `-d` parameter runs the client in DEBUG mode which is useful for debugging command failures.

   For example:
   ```
   ./fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://rcaadmin:rcaadminpw@my-machine.example.com:7055 --tls.certfiles tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem --csr.hosts 'host1,*.example.com' --mspdir org1-ca/rcaadmin/msp
   ```

   When this command runs, the enroll command creates the `fabric-ca-client/org1-ca/rcaadmin/msp` folder and contains the signed cert and private key for the organization CA and looks similar to:

   ```
   └── msp
       ├── cacerts
           └── my-machine-example-com-7055.pem
       ├── keystore
           └── 60b6a16b8b5ba3fc3113c522cce86a724d7eb92d6c3961cfd9afbd27bf11c37f_sk
       ├── signcerts
           └── cert.pem
       ├── user
       ├── IssuerPublicKey
       └── IssuerRevocationPublicKey       
    ```

   Where:
   - `my-machine-example-com-7055.pem` is the **Organization CA root certificate**.
   - `60b6a16b8b5ba3fc3113c522cce86a724d7eb92d6c3961cfd9afbd27bf11c37f_sk` is the **private key** for the organization CA admin identity. This key needs to be protected and should not be shared with anyone. It is required to be able to register and enroll other identities with this CA. Feel free to rename this file to something easier to reference, for example `org1-key.pem`.
   - `cert.pem` is the CA admin identity **signed certificate**.

3. (Optional) Register the intermediate CA bootstrap identity with the organization (root) CA.

    If you plan to deploy an intermediate CA, you must register the intermediate CA bootstrap identity with its root CA in order to form the chain of trust. Recall that you already registered the `icaadmin` identity with the TLS CA. You also need to register the same identity with the (root) organization CA. And because this will be an intermediate CA, you must include the `hf.IntermediateCA=true` attribute.  (Run this command from the same terminal window where you enrolled the organization CA admin in the previous step.)
     ```
     ./fabric-ca-client register -u https://my-machine.example.com:7055  --id.name icaadmin --id.secret icaadminpw --id.attrs '"hf.Registrar.Roles=user,admin","hf.Revoker=true","hf.IntermediateCA=true"' --tls.certfiles tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem --mspdir org1-ca/rcaadmin/msp
     ```   

     The `--mspdir` flag on the register command points to the crypto material for the organization CA admin that we enrolled in the previous step and is authorized to register new users. We don't enroll the `icaadmin` identity with the organization CA. Rather this intermediate CA admin identity is enrolled later against the intermediate CA.

## (Optional) Deploy an intermediate CA

Intermediate CAs form a chain a trust with the organization root CA and can be used to direct enrollment requests for a specific organization to a single CA as well as protect the root of trust by shutting down the root CA. Thus, when intermediate CAs are used to process all of the enrollment requests, the root CA can be turned off.

**Note:** This section assumes that you have already [registered and enrolled](#optional-register-and-enroll-the-intermediate-ca-admin-with-the-tls-ca) the `icaadmin` identity with the TLS CA as well as the parent organization CA (step 3 immediately preceding this section).

### Before you begin

- Copy the Fabric CA server binary `fabric-ca-server` to a new directory on your machine. For purposes of these instructions, we put the binary in its own folder named `fabric-ca-server-int-ca`.
  ```
  mkdir fabric-ca-server-int-ca
  ```
  Copy the `fabric-ca-server` binary into this folder.
- Use the following commands to copy the CA admin TLS certificate and key pair that you generated in the previous step to a location that can be accessed by this CA server, for example `fabric-ca-server-int-ca/tls`. These are the `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem` and `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/msp/keystore/` files that were generated by the enroll command.

  **Note:** The following commands assume that:
  - The generated private key under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/keystore/` is renamed to `key.pem`.
  - The `fabric-ca-client` and `fabric-ca-server-int-ca` folders are at the same level in your file structure.

  ```
  cd fabric-ca-server-int-ca
  mkdir tls
  cp ../fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem tls && cp ../fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/msp/keystore/key.pem tls
  ```
- Because TLS communications are enabled, the intermediate CA needs the TLS CA root certificate to be able to securely communicate with the parent organization CA. Therefore, you need to copy the `fabric-ca-server-tls/ca-cert.pem`, that was generated when the TLS CA server was initialized, to the `tls` folder. Notice the file name is changed to `tls-ca-cert.pem` to make it clear this is the root certificate from the TLS CA.
  ```
  cp ../fabric-ca-server-tls/ca-cert.pem tls/tls-ca-cert.pem
  ```

The resulting folder structure is similar to the following structure. (Some folders and files have been omitted for clarity):

  ```
  fabric-ca-client
    └── tls-ca
          ├── icaadmin
            ├── msp
               ├── cacerts
               ├── keystore
                   └── key.pem
               ├── signcerts
                   └── cert.pem
               ├── tlscacerts
               ├── user
               ├── IssuerPublicKey
               └── IssuerRevocationPublicKey
  fabric-ca-server-int-ca
    └── tls
      └── tls-ca-cert.pem
      └── cert.pem
      └── key.pem
  ```

Because you have already deployed the parent organization (root) CA, you can use the following steps to create the intermediate CA:

1. From the intermediate CA home directory, initialize the CA by running the `init` command and bootstrapping the `icaadmin` id that you already registered with the TLS CA and parent organization CA. For example:
   ```
   ./fabric-ca-server init -b icaadmin:icaadminpw
   ```
2. Modify the `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml` file.
   * `port`: Specify a unique port for this server. These instructions use `7056`, but you can choose your port.
   * `tls.enabled`: Must be set to `true`.
   * `tls.certfile` and `tls.keystore`: Enter the path and filename for the TLS CA signed certificate and private key. These are the certificate and private key files that you created when you enrolled the `icaadmin` user with the TLS CA. The signed certificate, `cert.pem` can be found under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem`. The private key is located under `fabric-ca-client/tls-ca/icaadmin/msp/keystore`. The specified path name is relative to `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME` therefore if you are following the folder structure that is used throughout these instructions you can simply specify `tls/cert.pem` for the `tls.certfile` and `tls/key.pem` for the `tls.keystore` or you can specify the fully qualified path name.
   * `ca`: Specify a name for the ca. For example `ica`.
   * `signing.profiles.ca.caconstraint.maxpathlen`: Set this value to 0, meaning there are no more intermediate CA's under this one. The default value is `0`.
   * `csr.cn`: The common name must be blank for intermediate CAs.
   * `csr.ca.pathlength`: Set this value to 0.
   * `intermediate.parentserver.url`: Enter the value of the parent server URL, in the form `https://<ROOT-CA-ADMIN>:<ROOT-CA-ADMIN-PW>@<CA-URL>:<PORT>`, for example `https://rcaadmin:rcaadminpw@my-machine.example.com:7055`.
   * `intermediate.parentserver.caname`: Enter the value of the parent server `caname` from the parent organization CA server configuration .yaml file. In this tutorial, we named that CA, `org1-ca`.
   * `intermediate.enrollment.hosts`: Enter the host name that the intermediate CA server is listening on.
   * `intermediate.enrollment.profile`: Enter the name of the signing profile from `signing.profile` section to use when issuing certificates. Normally this value is `ca`.
   * `intermediate.tls.certfiles`: Enter the path and file name to the TLS CA root `tls-ca-cert.pem` file. If you are following the folder structure that is used throughout these instructions you can simply specify `tls/tls-ca-cert.pem`.
   * `operations.listenAddress`: If another CA is running on the same host, you need to specify a unique port.
3. **Important:** You must delete the intermediate CA `fabric-ca-server-int-ca/ca-cert.pem` and `fabric-ca-server-int-ca/msp` folders in order for them to be regenerated with the intermediate CA settings.
4. Start the intermediate CA server. Because the intermediate CA bootstrap identity is enrolled with the parent organization (root) CA when the server is started, **ensure that the parent organziation CA is running before you start the intermediate CA**.
   ```
   ./fabric-ca-server start
   ```

   As this is an intermediate CA server, notice that a `ca-chain.pem` file is generated. This file contains the certificate chain, and includes the intermediate CA `ca-cert.pem` as well as the root CA `ca-cert.pem`.

### Enroll the Intermediate CA admin

The final step for deploying the intermediate CA is to enroll the intermediate CA admin to generate the node signed certificate and private key which is required for the identity to be able to enroll other identities. You should have already setup the required folders in the [Fabric CA client](#fabric-ca-client) section.

The folder structure we are using for these commands is
  ```
  fabric-ca-client
    └── int-ca
    └── tls-root-cert
  ```
  These folders are used by the Fabric CA client to:
   - Store the certificates that are issued when the Fabric CA client enroll command is run against the TLS CA server. (**int-ca** folder)
   -  Know where the TLS certificate resides that allows the Fabric CA client to communicate with the TLS CA server. (**tls-root-cert** folder)

1. When you previously used the Fabric CA client to generate certificates for the TLS CA and organization CA, you designated the value of the `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME`. Assuming that is still set, you can proceed to the next step. Otherwise, you should be in the directory where the Fabric CA client binary resides and run the command:

    ```
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$PWD
    ```

2. Now you can use the Fabric CA client to generate the CA admin certificate and private key. You need this certificate and private key to be able to issue identities using this CA. We use the `--mspdir` flag on the enroll command to designate where to store the generated certificates. Run the command:
  ```
  ./fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://<ADMIN>:<ADMIN-PWD>@<CA-URL>:<PORT> --tls.certfiles <RELATIVE-PATH-TO-TLS-CERT> --csr.hosts '<CA_HOSTNAME>' --mspdir int-ca/icaadmin/msp
  ```
  Replace:
  - `<ADMIN>` - with the intermediate CA admin specified on the `init` command.
  - `<ADMIN-PWD>` - with the intermediate CA admin password specified on the `init` command.
  - `<CA-URL>` - with the hostname specified in the `csr` section of the intermediate CA configuration .yaml file.
  - `<PORT>` - with the port that the intermediate CA is listening on.
  - `<RELATIVE-PATH-TO-TLS-CERT>` - with the path to the tls-ca-cert.pem file that you copied from your TLS CA. This is the path relative to `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME`.
  - `<CA_HOSTNAME>` - with a comma-separated list of host names for which the certificate should be valid. If not specified, the default value from the `fabric-ca-client-config.yaml` is used. If a host name is dynamic you can specify a wildcard for the domain. For example, when you include the flag `--csr.hosts 'host1,*.example.com'` it means that the hostname `host1` is recognized as well as any host from the `example.com` domain.

  For example:
  ```
  ./fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://icaadmin:icaadminpw@my-machine.example.com:7056 --tls.certfiles tls-root-cert/tls-ca-cert.pem --csr.hosts 'host1,*.example.com' --mspdir int-ca/icaadmin/msp
  ```
When the enroll command runs, it creates the `fabric-ca-client/int-ca/icaadmin/msp` folder and contains the signed cert and private key for the intermediate CA. Notice the `/intermediatecerts` folder is also created and populated with the intermediate CA certificate which connects this intermediate CA to the root CA.

**Tip:** After the intermediate CA is successfully deployed and you can register and enroll identities, then you can safely turn off the parent server root CA, the organization CA.

## Next steps

Minimally, you should now have a TLS CA and an organization CA configured for your organization. You can now use the Fabric CA client to register and enroll node admin identities, node identities, and organization identities with the TLS CA to generate their TLS certificates required for server side TLS communications. Likewise you will also need to register and enroll the same node admins and users with the organization CA to generate their enrollment certificates and MSPs. See [Use the CA to create identities and MSPs](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.1/deployment_guide_overview.html#dg-step-four-use-the-ca-to-create-identities-and-msps) for more information. If you did configure an intermediate CA, you can now use that CA to register and enroll identities for the organization instead of the root CA.

**Tip:** When you subsequently use the Fabric CA client to register identities with the intermediate CA, ensure that you specify the `--mspdir int-ca/icaadmin/msp` on the register command.

## Troubleshooting CA Deployment

### Fabric CA client `enroll` command fails

**Problem:** When running an enroll command with the Fabric CA client CLI, it fails with:
```
Error: Failed to read config file at '/Users/mwp/.fabric-ca-client/fabric-ca-client-config.yaml': While parsing config: yaml: line 42: mapping values are not allowed in this context
```

**Solution:**

This error occurs when the `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME` is not set. Ensure that you have set the `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME` environment variable to point to the location of the Fabric CA client binary. Navigate to the folder where the `fabric-ca-client.exe` binary file resides and run the command:

```
export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$PWD
```

Note that when `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME` is set and an enrollment command fails, it is recommended that should delete the generated `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME/msp` folder and the generated `fabric-ca-client.yaml` file to avoid confusion before reattempting the enrollment command.

### Intermediate CA server fails to start

**Problem:** The intermediate CA server fails to start with the error:
```
Error: Response from server: Error Code: 0 - Certificate signing failure: {"code":5300,"message":"Policy violation request"}
```
You may also see the associated error on the root CA:
```
[ERROR] local signer certificate disallows CA MaxPathLen extending
[INFO] 9.27.117.220:49864 POST /enroll 500 0 "Certificate signing failure: {"code":5300,"message":"Policy violation request"}"

```
**Solution:**
The values of the `signing.profiles.ca.caconstraint.maxpathlen` and the `csr.ca.pathlength` fields in the intermediate CA configuration .yaml file need to be set to 0.

### Starting the intermediate CA fails

**Problem:** When you start the intermediate CA it fails with an error:
```
Post https://host1.com:7060/enroll: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

And the Root organization CA, has the error:
```
TLS handshake error from 192.168.1.134:63094: remote error: tls: bad certificate
```

**Solution:**
This problem occurs during enrollment of the intermediate CA admin user with the root CA when the intermediate CA server is started. To resolve this problem, make sure that the TLS certificate that is specified in the `intermediate.tls.certfiles` section of the intermediate CA `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml` file points to the TLS CA root certificate. If you are following these instructions it will be  `tls/tls-ca-cert.pem`.

### Enrolling the intermediate CA admin user fails

**Problem:** When you start the intermediate CA and the process fails with the error:
```
Error: Response from server: Error Code: 0 - Chain file does not exist at /fabric-ca-server-int-ca/ca-chain.pem
```

**Solution:**

Because you modified the `csr` block of the intermediate CA configuration file, you need to delete the intermediate CA, `ca-cert.pem` file and the `/msp` folder before you start the intermediate CA server.
