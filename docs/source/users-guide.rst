Fabric CA User's Guide
======================

The Hyperledger Fabric CA is a Certificate Authority (CA)
for Hyperledger Fabric.

It provides features such as:

  * registration of identities, or connects to LDAP as the user
    registry
  * issuance of Enrollment Certificates (ECerts)
  * certificate renewal and revocation

Hyperledger Fabric CA consists of both a server and a client component as
described later in this document.

For developers interested in contributing to Hyperledger Fabric CA, see the
`Fabric CA repository <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca>`__ for more
information.

Overview
--------

The diagram below illustrates how the Hyperledger Fabric CA server fits into the
overall Hyperledger Fabric architecture.

.. image:: ./images/fabric-ca.png

There are two ways of interacting with a Hyperledger Fabric CA server:
via the Hyperledger Fabric CA client or through one of the Fabric SDKs.
All communication to the Hyperledger Fabric CA server is via REST APIs.
See `fabric-ca/swagger/swagger-fabric-ca.json` for the swagger documentation
for these REST APIs.
You may view this documentation via the http://editor2.swagger.io online editor.

The Hyperledger Fabric CA client or SDK may connect to a server in a cluster
of Hyperledger Fabric CA servers.   This is illustrated in the top right section
of the diagram. The client routes to an HA Proxy endpoint which load balances
traffic to one of the fabric-ca-server cluster members.

All Hyperledger Fabric CA servers in a cluster share the same database for
keeping track of identities and certificates.  If LDAP is configured, the identity
information is kept in LDAP rather than the database.

A server may contain multiple CAs.  Each CA is either a root CA or an
intermediate CA.  Each intermediate CA has a parent CA which is either a
root CA or another intermediate CA.

Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Go 1.10+ installation
-  ``GOPATH`` environment variable is set correctly
- libtool and libtdhl-dev packages are installed

The following installs the libtool dependencies on Ubuntu:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install libtool libltdl-dev

The following installs the libtool dependencies on MacOSX:

.. code:: bash

   brew install libtool

.. note:: libtldl-dev is not necessary on MacOSX if you instal
          libtool via Homebrew

For more information on libtool, see https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool.

For more information on libltdl-dev, see https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Using-libltdl.html.

Install
~~~~~~~

The following installs both the `fabric-ca-server` and `fabric-ca-client` binaries
in $GOPATH/bin.

.. code:: bash

    go get -u github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/cmd/...

Note: If you have already cloned the fabric-ca repository, make sure you are on the
master branch before running the 'go get' command above. Otherwise, you might see the
following error:

::

    <gopath>/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca; git pull --ff-only
    There is no tracking information for the current branch.
    Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
    See git-pull(1) for details.

        git pull <remote> <branch>

    If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

        git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch> tlsdoc

    package github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/cmd/fabric-ca-client: exit status 1

Start Server Natively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following starts the `fabric-ca-server` with default settings.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw

The `-b` option provides the enrollment ID and secret for a bootstrap
administrator; this is required if LDAP is not enabled with the "ldap.enabled"
setting.

A default configuration file named `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml`
is created in the local directory which can be customized.

Start Server via Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Docker Hub
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to: https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-ca/tags/

Find the tag that matches the architecture and version of fabric-ca
that you want to pull.

Navigate to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/docker/server`
and open up docker-compose.yml in an editor.

Change the `image` line to reflect the tag you found previously. The file
may look like this for an x86 architecture for version beta.

.. code:: yaml

    fabric-ca-server:
      image: hyperledger/fabric-ca:x86_64-1.0.0-beta
      container_name: fabric-ca-server
      ports:
        - "7054:7054"
      environment:
        - FABRIC_CA_HOME=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server
      volumes:
        - "./fabric-ca-server:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server"
      command: sh -c 'fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw'

Open up a terminal in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file
and execute the following:

.. code:: bash

    # docker-compose up -d

This will pull down the specified fabric-ca image in the Compose file
if it does not already exist, and start an instance of the fabric-ca
server.

Building Your Own Docker image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can build and start the server via Docker Compose as shown below.

.. code:: bash

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca
    make docker
    cd docker/server
    docker-compose up -d

The hyperledger/fabric-ca Docker image contains both the fabric-ca-server and
the fabric-ca-client.

.. code:: bash

    # cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca
    # FABRIC_CA_DYNAMIC_LINK=true make docker
    # cd docker/server
    # docker-compose up -d

Explore the Fabric CA CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section simply provides the usage messages for the Fabric CA server and client
for convenience.  Additional usage information is provided in following sections.

The following links shows the :doc:`Server Command Line <servercli>` and
:doc:`Client Command Line <clientcli>`.

.. note:: Note that command line options that are string slices (lists) can be
          specified either by specifying the option with comma-separated list
          elements or by specifying the option multiple times, each with a
          string value that make up the list. For example, to specify
          ``host1`` and ``host2`` for the ``csr.hosts`` option, you can either
          pass ``--csr.hosts 'host1,host2'`` or
          ``--csr.hosts host1 --csr.hosts host2``. When using the former format,
          please make sure there are no space before or after any commas.

Configuration Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fabric CA provides 3 ways to configure settings on the Fabric CA server
and client. The precedence order is:

  1. CLI flags
  2. Environment variables
  3. Configuration file

In the remainder of this document, we refer to making changes to
configuration files. However, configuration file changes can be
overridden through environment variables or CLI flags.

For example, if we have the following in the client configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

    tls:
      # Enable TLS (default: false)
      enabled: false

      # TLS for the client's listenting port (default: false)
      certfiles:
      client:
        certfile: cert.pem
        keyfile:

The following environment variable may be used to override the ``cert.pem``
setting in the configuration file:

.. code:: bash

  export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CLIENT_CERTFILE=cert2.pem

If we wanted to override both the environment variable and configuration
file, we can use a command line flag.

.. code:: bash

  fabric-ca-client enroll --tls.client.certfile cert3.pem

The same approach applies to fabric-ca-server, except instead of using
``FABIRC_CA_CLIENT`` as the prefix to environment variables,
``FABRIC_CA_SERVER`` is used.

.. _server:

A word on file paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All the properties in the Fabric CA server and client configuration file
that specify file names support both relative and absolute paths.
Relative paths are relative to the config directory, where the
configuration file is located. For example, if the config directory is
``~/config`` and the tls section is as shown below, the Fabric CA server
or client will look for the ``root.pem`` file in the ``~/config``
directory, ``cert.pem`` file in the ``~/config/certs`` directory and the
``key.pem`` file in the ``/abs/path`` directory

.. code:: yaml

    tls:
      enabled: true
      certfiles:
        - root.pem
      client:
        certfile: certs/cert.pem
        keyfile: /abs/path/key.pem

Fabric CA Server
----------------

This section describes the Fabric CA server.

You may initialize the Fabric CA server before starting it. This provides an
opportunity for you to generate a default configuration file that can be
reviewed and customized before starting the server.

The Fabric CA server's home directory is determined as follows:
  - if the --home command line option is set, use its value
  - otherwise, if the ``FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME`` environment variable is set, use
    its value
  - otherwise, if ``FABRIC_CA_HOME`` environment variable is set, use
    its value
  - otherwise, if the ``CA_CFG_PATH`` environment variable is set, use
    its value
  - otherwise, use current working directory

For the remainder of this server section, we assume that you have set
the ``FABRIC_CA_HOME`` environment variable to
``$HOME/fabric-ca/server``.

The instructions below assume that the server configuration file exists
in the server's home directory.

.. _initialize:

Initializing the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the Fabric CA server as follows:

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-server init -b admin:adminpw

The ``-b`` (bootstrap identity) option is required for initialization when
LDAP is disabled. At least one bootstrap identity is required to start the
Fabric CA server; this identity is the server administrator.

The server configuration file contains a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
section that can be configured. The following is a sample CSR.

.. _csr-fields:

.. code:: yaml

   cn: fabric-ca-server
   names:
      - C: US
        ST: "North Carolina"
        L:
        O: Hyperledger
        OU: Fabric
   hosts:
     - host1.example.com
     - localhost
   ca:
      expiry: 131400h
      pathlength: 1

All of the fields above pertain to the X.509 signing key and certificate which
is generated by the ``fabric-ca-server init``.  This corresponds to the
``ca.certfile`` and ``ca.keyfile`` files in the server's configuration file.
The fields are as follows:

  -  **cn** is the Common Name
  -  **O** is the organization name
  -  **OU** is the organizational unit
  -  **L** is the location or city
  -  **ST** is the state
  -  **C** is the country

If custom values for the CSR are required, you may customize the configuration
file, delete the files specified by the ``ca.certfile`` and ``ca.keyfile``
configuration items, and then run the ``fabric-ca-server init -b admin:adminpw``
command again.

The ``fabric-ca-server init`` command generates a self-signed CA certificate
unless the ``-u <parent-fabric-ca-server-URL>`` option is specified.
If the ``-u`` is specified, the server's CA certificate is signed by the
parent Fabric CA server.
In order to authenticate to the parent Fabric CA server, the URL must
be of the form ``<scheme>://<enrollmentID>:<secret>@<host>:<port>``, where
<enrollmentID> and <secret> correspond to an identity with an 'hf.IntermediateCA'
attribute whose value equals 'true'.
The ``fabric-ca-server init`` command also generates a default configuration
file named **fabric-ca-server-config.yaml** in the server's home directory.

If you want the Fabric CA server to use a CA signing certificate and key file which you provide,
you must place your files in the location referenced by ``ca.certfile`` and ``ca.keyfile`` respectively.
Both files must be PEM-encoded and must not be encrypted.
More specifically, the contents of the CA certificate file must begin with ``-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----``
and the contents of the key file must begin with ``-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`` and not
``-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----``.

Algorithms and key sizes

The CSR can be customized to generate X.509 certificates and keys that
support Elliptic Curve (ECDSA). The following setting is an
example of the implementation of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm (ECDSA) with curve ``prime256v1`` and signature algorithm
``ecdsa-with-SHA256``:

.. code:: yaml

    key:
       algo: ecdsa
       size: 256

The choice of algorithm and key size are based on security needs.

Elliptic Curve (ECDSA) offers the following key size options:

+--------+--------------+-----------------------+
| size   | ASN1 OID     | Signature Algorithm   |
+========+==============+=======================+
| 256    | prime256v1   | ecdsa-with-SHA256     |
+--------+--------------+-----------------------+
| 384    | secp384r1    | ecdsa-with-SHA384     |
+--------+--------------+-----------------------+
| 521    | secp521r1    | ecdsa-with-SHA512     |
+--------+--------------+-----------------------+

Starting the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start the Fabric CA server as follows:

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-server start -b <admin>:<adminpw>

If the server has not been previously initialized, it will initialize
itself as it starts for the first time.  During this initialization, the
server will generate the ca-cert.pem and ca-key.pem files if they don't
yet exist and will also create a default configuration file if it does
not exist.  See the `Initialize the Fabric CA server <#initialize>`__ section.

Unless the Fabric CA server is configured to use LDAP, it must be
configured with at least one pre-registered bootstrap identity to enable you
to register and enroll other identities. The ``-b`` option specifies the
name and password for a bootstrap identity.

To cause the Fabric CA server to listen on ``https`` rather than
``http``, set ``tls.enabled`` to ``true``.

SECURITY WARNING: The Fabric CA server should always be started with TLS
enabled (``tls.enabled`` set to true). Failure to do so leaves the
server vulnerable to an attacker with access to network traffic.

To limit the number of times that the same secret (or password) can be
used for enrollment, set the ``registry.maxenrollments`` in the configuration
file to the appropriate value. If you set the value to 1, the Fabric CA
server allows passwords to only be used once for a particular enrollment
ID. If you set the value to -1, the Fabric CA server places no limit on
the number of times that a secret can be reused for enrollment. The
default value is -1. Setting the value to 0, the Fabric CA server will
disable enrollment for all identities and registration of identities will
not be allowed.

The Fabric CA server should now be listening on port 7054.

You may skip to the `Fabric CA Client <#fabric-ca-client>`__ section if
you do not want to configure the Fabric CA server to run in a cluster or
to use LDAP.

Configuring the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to configure the Fabric CA server to connect
to PostgreSQL or MySQL databases. The default database is SQLite and the
default database file is ``fabric-ca-server.db`` in the Fabric CA
server's home directory.

If you don't care about running the Fabric CA server in a cluster, you
may skip this section; otherwise, you must configure either PostgreSQL or
MySQL as described below. Fabric CA supports the following database
versions in a cluster setup:

- PostgreSQL: 9.5.5 or later
- MySQL: 5.7 or later

PostgreSQL
^^^^^^^^^^

The following sample may be added to the server's configuration file in
order to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Be sure to customize the
various values appropriately. There are limitations on what characters are allowed
in the database name. Please refer to the following Postgres documentation
for more information: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS

.. code:: yaml

    db:
      type: postgres
      datasource: host=localhost port=5432 user=Username password=Password dbname=fabric_ca sslmode=verify-full

Specifying *sslmode* configures the type of SSL authentication. Valid
values for sslmode are:

|

+----------------+----------------+
| Mode           | Description    |
+================+================+
| disable        | No SSL         |
+----------------+----------------+
| require        | Always SSL     |
|                | (skip          |
|                | verification)  |
+----------------+----------------+
| verify-ca      | Always SSL     |
|                | (verify that   |
|                | the            |
|                | certificate    |
|                | presented by   |
|                | the server was |
|                | signed by a    |
|                | trusted CA)    |
+----------------+----------------+
| verify-full    | Same as        |
|                | verify-ca AND  |
|                | verify that    |
|                | the            |
|                | certificate    |
|                | presented by   |
|                | the server was |
|                | signed by a    |
|                | trusted CA and |
|                | the server     |
|                | hostname       |
|                | matches the    |
|                | one in the     |
|                | certificate    |
+----------------+----------------+

|

If you would like to use TLS, then the ``db.tls`` section in the Fabric CA server
configuration file must be specified. If SSL client authentication is enabled
on the PostgreSQL server, then the client certificate and key file must also be
specified in the ``db.tls.client`` section. The following is an example
of the ``db.tls`` section:

.. code:: yaml

    db:
      ...
      tls:
          enabled: true
          certfiles:
            - db-server-cert.pem
          client:
                certfile: db-client-cert.pem
                keyfile: db-client-key.pem

| **certfiles** - A list of PEM-encoded trusted root certificate files.
| **certfile** and **keyfile** - PEM-encoded certificate and key files that are used by the Fabric CA server to communicate securely with the PostgreSQL server

PostgreSQL SSL Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Basic instructions for configuring SSL on the PostgreSQL server:**

1. In postgresql.conf, uncomment SSL and set to "on" (SSL=on)

2. Place certificate and key files in the PostgreSQL data directory.

Instructions for generating self-signed certificates for:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/ssl-tcp.html

Note: Self-signed certificates are for testing purposes and should not
be used in a production environment

**PostgreSQL Server - Require Client Certificates**

1. Place certificates of the certificate authorities (CAs) you trust in the file root.crt in the PostgreSQL data directory

2. In postgresql.conf, set "ssl\_ca\_file" to point to the root cert of the client (CA cert)

3. Set the clientcert parameter to 1 on the appropriate hostssl line(s) in pg\_hba.conf.

For more details on configuring SSL on the PostgreSQL server, please refer
to the following PostgreSQL documentation:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/libpq-ssl.html

MySQL
^^^^^^^

The following sample may be added to the Fabric CA server configuration file in
order to connect to a MySQL database. Be sure to customize the various
values appropriately. There are limitations on what characters are allowed
in the database name. Please refer to the following MySQL documentation
for more information: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifiers.html

On MySQL 5.7.X, certain modes affect whether the server permits '0000-00-00' as a valid date.
It might be necessary to relax the modes that MySQL server uses. We want to allow
the server to be able to accept zero date values.

In my.cnf, find the configuration option *sql_mode* and remove *NO_ZERO_DATE* if present.
Restart MySQL server after making this change.

Please refer to the following MySQL documentation on different modes available
and select the appropriate settings for the specific version of MySQL that is
being used.

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html

.. code:: yaml

    db:
      type: mysql
      datasource: root:rootpw@tcp(localhost:3306)/fabric_ca?parseTime=true&tls=custom

If connecting over TLS to the MySQL server, the ``db.tls.client``
section is also required as described in the **PostgreSQL** section above.

MySQL SSL Configuration
""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Basic instructions for configuring SSL on MySQL server:**

1. Open or create my.cnf file for the server. Add or uncomment the
   lines below in the [mysqld] section. These should point to the key and
   certificates for the server, and the root CA cert.

   Instructions on creating server and client-side certficates:
   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/creating-ssl-files-using-openssl.html

   [mysqld] ssl-ca=ca-cert.pem ssl-cert=server-cert.pem ssl-key=server-key.pem

   Can run the following query to confirm SSL has been enabled.

   mysql> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'have\_%ssl';

   Should see:

   +----------------+----------------+
   | Variable_name  | Value          |
   +================+================+
   | have_openssl   | YES            |
   +----------------+----------------+
   | have_ssl       | YES            |
   +----------------+----------------+

2. After the server-side SSL configuration is finished, the next step is
   to create a user who has a privilege to access the MySQL server over
   SSL. For that, log in to the MySQL server, and type:

   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'ssluser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY
   'password' REQUIRE SSL; mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   If you want to give a specific IP address from which the user will
   access the server change the '%' to the specific IP address.

**MySQL Server - Require Client Certificates**

Options for secure connections are similar to those used on the server side.

-  ssl-ca identifies the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. This
   option, if used, must specify the same certificate used by the server.
-  ssl-cert identifies MySQL server's certificate.
-  ssl-key identifies MySQL server's private key.

Suppose that you want to connect using an account that has no special
encryption requirements or was created using a GRANT statement that
includes the REQUIRE SSL option. As a recommended set of
secure-connection options, start the MySQL server with at least
--ssl-cert and --ssl-key options. Then set the ``db.tls.certfiles`` property
in the server configuration file and start the Fabric CA server.

To require that a client certificate also be specified, create the
account using the REQUIRE X509 option. Then the client must also specify
proper client key and certificate files; otherwise, the MySQL server
will reject the connection. To specify client key and certificate files
for the Fabric CA server, set the ``db.tls.client.certfile``,
and ``db.tls.client.keyfile`` configuration properties.

Configuring LDAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fabric CA server can be configured to read from an LDAP server.

In particular, the Fabric CA server may connect to an LDAP server to do
the following:

-  authenticate an identity prior to enrollment
-  retrieve an identity's attribute values which are used for authorization.

Modify the LDAP section of the Fabric CA server's configuration file to configure the
server to connect to an LDAP server.

.. code:: yaml

    ldap:
       # Enables or disables the LDAP client (default: false)
       enabled: false
       # The URL of the LDAP server
       url: <scheme>://<adminDN>:<adminPassword>@<host>:<port>/<base>
       userfilter: <filter>
       attribute:
          # 'names' is an array of strings that identify the specific attributes
          # which are requested from the LDAP server.
          names: <LDAPAttrs>
          # The 'converters' section is used to convert LDAP attribute values
          # to fabric CA attribute values.
          #
          # For example, the following converts an LDAP 'uid' attribute
          # whose value begins with 'revoker' to a fabric CA attribute
          # named "hf.Revoker" with a value of "true" (because the expression
          # evaluates to true).
          #    converters:
          #       - name: hf.Revoker
          #         value: attr("uid") =~ "revoker*"
          #
          # As another example, assume a user has an LDAP attribute named
          # 'member' which has multiple values of "dn1", "dn2", and "dn3".
          # Further assume the following configuration.
          #    converters:
          #       - name: myAttr
          #         value: map(attr("member"),"groups")
          #    maps:
          #       groups:
          #          - name: dn1
          #            value: client
          #          - name: dn2
          #            value: peer
          # The value of the user's 'myAttr' attribute is then computed to be
          # "client,peer,dn3".  This is because the value of 'attr("member")' is
          # "dn1,dn2,dn3", and the call to 'map' with a 2nd argument of
          # "group" replaces "dn1" with "client" and "dn2" with "peer".
          converters:
            - name: <fcaAttrName>
              value: <fcaExpr>
          maps:
            <mapName>:
                - name: <from>
                  value: <to>

Where:

  * ``scheme`` is one of *ldap* or *ldaps*;
  * ``adminDN`` is the distinquished name of the admin user;
  * ``pass`` is the password of the admin user;
  * ``host`` is the hostname or IP address of the LDAP server;
  * ``port`` is the optional port number, where default 389 for *ldap*
    and 636 for *ldaps*;
  * ``base`` is the optional root of the LDAP tree to use for searches;
  * ``filter`` is a filter to use when searching to convert a login
    user name to a distinguished name. For example, a value of
    ``(uid=%s)`` searches for LDAP entries with the value of a ``uid``
    attribute whose value is the login user name. Similarly,
    ``(email=%s)`` may be used to login with an email address.
  * ``LDAPAttrs`` is an array of LDAP attribute names to request from the
    LDAP server on a user's behalf;
  * the attribute.converters section is used to convert LDAP attributes to fabric
    CA attributes, where
    * ``fcaAttrName`` is the name of a fabric CA attribute;
    * ``fcaExpr`` is an expression whose evaluated value is assigned to the fabric CA attribute.
    For example, suppose that <LDAPAttrs> is ["uid"], <fcaAttrName> is 'hf.Revoker',
    and <fcaExpr> is 'attr("uid") =~ "revoker*"'.  This means that an attribute
    named "uid" is requested from the LDAP server on a user's behalf.  The user is
    then given a value of 'true' for the 'hf.Revoker' attribute if the value of
    the user's 'uid' LDAP attribute begins with 'revoker'; otherwise, the user
    is given a value of 'false' for the 'hf.Revoker' attribute.
  * the attribute.maps section is used to map LDAP response values.  The typical
    use case is to map a distinguished name associated with an LDAP group to an
    identity type.

The LDAP expression language uses the govaluate package as described at
https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate/blob/master/MANUAL.md.  This defines
operators such as "=~" and literals such as "revoker*", which is a regular
expression.  The LDAP-specific variables and functions which extend the
base govaluate language are as follows:

  * ``DN`` is a variable equal to the user's distinguished name.
  * ``affiliation`` is a variable equal to the user's affiliation.
  * ``attr`` is a function which takes 1 or 2 arguments.  The 1st argument
    is an LDAP attribute name.  The 2nd argument is a separator string which is
    used to join multiple values into a single string; the default separator
    string is ",". The ``attr`` function always returns a value of type
    'string'.
  * ``map`` is a function which takes 2 arguments.  The 1st argument
    is any string.  The second argument is the name of a map which is used to
    perform string substitution on the string from the 1st argument.
  * ``if`` is a function which takes a 3 arguments where the first argument
    must resolve to a boolean value.  If it evaluates to true, the second
    argument is returned; otherwise, the third argument is returned.

For example, the following expression evaluates to true if the user has
a distinguished name ending in "O=org1,C=US", or if the user has an affiliation
beginning with "org1.dept2." and also has the "admin" attribute of "true".

  **DN =~ "*O=org1,C=US" || (affiliation =~ "org1.dept2.*" && attr('admin') = 'true')**

NOTE: Since the ``attr`` function always returns a value of type 'string',
numeric operators may not be used to construct expressions.
For example, the following is NOT a valid expression:

.. code:: yaml

     value: attr("gidNumber) >= 10000 && attr("gidNumber) < 10006

Alternatively, a regular expression enclosed in quotes as shown below may be used
to return an equivalent result:

.. code:: yaml

     value: attr("gidNumber") =~ "1000[0-5]$" || attr("mail") == "root@example.com"

The following is a sample configuration section for the default setting
for the OpenLDAP server whose Docker image is at
``https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap``.

.. code:: yaml

    ldap:
       enabled: true
       url: ldap://cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org:admin@localhost:10389/dc=example,dc=org
       userfilter: (uid=%s)

See ``FABRIC_CA/scripts/run-ldap-tests`` for a script which starts an
OpenLDAP Docker image, configures it, runs the LDAP tests in
``FABRIC_CA/cli/server/ldap/ldap_test.go``, and stops the OpenLDAP
server.

When LDAP is configured, enrollment works as follows:


-  The Fabric CA client or client SDK sends an enrollment request with a
   basic authorization header.
-  The Fabric CA server receives the enrollment request, decodes the
   identity name and password in the authorization header, looks up the DN (Distinguished
   Name) associated with the identity name using the "userfilter" from the
   configuration file, and then attempts an LDAP bind with the identity's
   password. If the LDAP bind is successful, the enrollment processing is
   authorized and can proceed.

Setting up a cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may use any IP sprayer to load balance to a cluster of Fabric CA
servers. This section provides an example of how to set up Haproxy to
route to a Fabric CA server cluster. Be sure to change hostname and port
to reflect the settings of your Fabric CA servers.

haproxy.conf

.. code::

    global
          maxconn 4096
          daemon

    defaults
          mode http
          maxconn 2000
          timeout connect 5000
          timeout client 50000
          timeout server 50000

    listen http-in
          bind *:7054
          balance roundrobin
          server server1 hostname1:port
          server server2 hostname2:port
          server server3 hostname3:port


Note: If using TLS, need to use ``mode tcp``.

Setting up multiple CAs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fabric-ca server by default consists of a single default CA. However, additional CAs
can be added to a single server by using `cafiles` or `cacount` configuration options.
Each additional CA will have its own home directory.

cacount:
^^^^^^^^

The `cacount` provides a quick way to start X number of default additional
CAs. The home directory will be relative to the server directory. With this option,
the directory structure will be as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    --<Server Home>
      |--ca
        |--ca1
        |--ca2

Each additional CA will get a default configuration file generated in it's home
directory, within the configuration file it will contain a unique CA name.

For example, the following command will start 2 default CA instances:

.. code:: bash

   fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw --cacount 2

cafiles:
^^^^^^^^

If absolute paths are not provided when using the cafiles configuration option,
the CA home directory will be relative to the server directory.

To use this option, CA configuration files must have already been generated and
configured for each CA that is to be started. Each configuration file must have
a unique CA name and Common Name (CN), otherwise the server will fail to start as these
names must be unique. The CA configuration files will override any default
CA configuration, and any missing options in the CA configuration files will be
replaced by the values from the default CA.

The precedence order will be as follows:

  1. CA Configuration file
  2. Default CA CLI flags
  3. Default CA Environment variables
  4. Default CA Configuration file

A CA configuration file must contain at least the following:

.. code:: yaml

    ca:
    # Name of this CA
    name: <CANAME>

    csr:
      cn: <COMMONNAME>

You may configure your directory structure as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    --<Server Home>
      |--ca
        |--ca1
          |-- fabric-ca-config.yaml
        |--ca2
          |-- fabric-ca-config.yaml

For example, the following command will start two customized CA instances:

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw --cafiles ca/ca1/fabric-ca-config.yaml
    --cafiles ca/ca2/fabric-ca-config.yaml


Enrolling an intermediate CA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to create a CA signing certificate for an intermediate CA, the intermediate
CA must enroll with a parent CA in the same way that a fabric-ca-client enrolls with a CA.
This is done by using the -u option to specify the URL of the parent CA and the enrollment ID
and secret as shown below.  The identity associated with this enrollment ID must have an
attribute with a name of "hf.IntermediateCA" and a value of "true".  The CN (or Common Name)
of the issued certificate will be set to the enrollment ID. An error will occur if an intermediate
CA tries to explicitly specify a CN value.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw -u http://<enrollmentID>:<secret>@<parentserver>:<parentport>

For other intermediate CA flags see `Fabric CA server's configuration file format`_ section.


Upgrading the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fabric CA server must be upgraded before upgrading the Fabric CA client.
Prior to upgrade, it is suggested that the current database be backed up:

- If using sqlite3, backup the current database file (which is named fabric-ca-server.db by default).
- For other database types, use the appropriate backup/replication mechanism.

To upgrade a single instance of Fabric CA server:

1. Stop the fabric-ca-server process.
2. Ensure the current database is backed up.
3. Replace previous fabric-ca-server binary with the upgraded version.
4. Launch the fabric-ca-server process.
5. Verify the fabric-ca-server process is available with the following
   command where <host> is the hostname on which the server was started::

      fabric-ca-client getcainfo -u http://<host>:7054

Upgrading a cluster:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To upgrade a cluster of fabric-ca-server instances using either a MySQL or Postgres database, perform the following procedure. We assume that you are using haproxy to load balance to two fabric-ca-server cluster members on host1 and host2, respectively, both listening on port 7054. After this procedure, you will be load balancing to upgraded fabric-ca-server cluster members on host3 and host4 respectively, both listening on port 7054.

In order to monitor the changes using haproxy stats, enable statistics collection. Add the following lines to the global section of the haproxy configuration file:

::

    stats socket /var/run/haproxy.sock mode 666 level operator
    stats timeout 2m

Restart haproxy to pick up the changes::

    # haproxy -f <configfile> -st $(pgrep haproxy)

To display summary information from the haproxy "show stat" command, the following function may prove useful for parsing the copious amount of CSV data returned:

.. code:: bash

    haProxyShowStats() {
       echo "show stat" | nc -U /var/run/haproxy.sock |sed '1s/^# *//'|
          awk -F',' -v fmt="%4s %12s %10s %6s %6s %4s %4s\n" '
             { if (NR==1) for (i=1;i<=NF;i++) f[tolower($i)]=i }
             { printf fmt, $f["sid"],$f["pxname"],$f["svname"],$f["status"],
                           $f["weight"],$f["act"],$f["bck"] }'
    }


1) Initially your haproxy configuration file is similar to the following::

      server server1 host1:7054 check
      server server2 host2:7054 check

   Change this configuration to the following::

      server server1 host1:7054 check backup
      server server2 host2:7054 check backup
      server server3 host3:7054 check
      server server4 host4:7054 check

2) Restart the HA proxy with the new configuration as follows::

      haproxy -f <configfile> -st $(pgrep haproxy)

   ``"haProxyShowStats"`` will now reflect the modified configuration,
   with two active, older-version backup servers and two (yet to be started) upgraded servers::

      sid   pxname      svname  status  weig  act  bck
        1   fabric-cas  server3   DOWN     1    1    0
        2   fabric-cas  server4   DOWN     1    1    0
        3   fabric-cas  server1     UP     1    0    1
        4   fabric-cas  server2     UP     1    0    1

3) Install upgraded binaries of fabric-ca-server on host3 and host4. The new
   upgraded servers on host3 and host4 should be configured to use the same
   database as their older counterparts on host1 and host2. After starting
   the upgraded servers, the database will be automatically migrated. The
   haproxy will forward all new traffic to the upgraded servers, since they
   are not configured as backup servers. Verify using the ``"fabric-ca-client getcainfo"``
   command that your cluster is still functioning appropriately before proceeding.
   Also, ``"haProxyShowStats"`` should now reflect that all servers are active,
   similar to the following::

      sid   pxname      svname  status  weig  act  bck
        1   fabric-cas  server3    UP     1    1    0
        2   fabric-cas  server4    UP     1    1    0
        3   fabric-cas  server1    UP     1    0    1
        4   fabric-cas  server2    UP     1    0    1

4) Stop the old servers on host1 and host2. Verify using the
   ``"fabric-ca-client getcainfo"`` command that your new cluster is still
   functioning appropriately before proceeding. Then remove the older
   server backup configuration from the haproxy configuration file,
   so that it looks similar to the following::

      server server3 host3:7054 check
      server server4 host4:7054 check

5) Restart the HA proxy with the new configuration as follows::

      haproxy -f <configfile> -st $(pgrep haproxy)

   ``"haProxyShowStats"`` will now reflect the modified configuration,
   with two active servers which have been upgraded to the new version::

      sid   pxname      svname  status  weig  act  bck
        1   fabric-cas  server3   UP       1    1    0
        2   fabric-cas  server4   UP       1    1    0

Operations Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CA Server hosts an HTTP server that offers a RESTful “operations” API. This API
is intended to be used by operators, not administrators or “users” of the network.

The API exposes the following capabilities:

    Prometheus target for operational metrics (when configured)

Configuring the Operations Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The operations service requires two basic pieces of configuration:

    The **address** and **port** to listen on.
    The **TLS certificates** and **keys** to use for authentication and encryption. Note, **these
    certificates should be generated by a separate and dedicated CA**. Do not use a CA that
    has generated certificates for any organizations in any channels.

The CA server can be configurated in the ``operations`` section of server's configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

  operations:
    # host and port for the operations server
    listenAddress: 127.0.0.1:9443

    # TLS configuration for the operations endpoint
    tls:
      # TLS enabled
      enabled: true

      # path to PEM encoded server certificate for the operations server
      cert:
        file: tls/server.crt

      # path to PEM encoded server key for the operations server
      key:
        file: tls/server.key

      # require client certificate authentication to access all resources
      clientAuthRequired: false

      # paths to PEM encoded ca certificates to trust for client authentication
      clientRootCAs:
        files: []

The ``listenAddress`` key defines the host and port that the operation server
will listen on. If the server should listen on all addresses, the host portion
can be omitted.

The ``tls`` section is used to indicate whether or not TLS is enabled for the
operations service, the location of the service's certificate and private key,
and the locations of certificate authority root certificates that should be
trusted for client authentication. When ``clientAuthRequired`` is ``true``,
clients will be required to provide a certificate for authentication.

Operations Security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the operations service is focused on operations and intentionally unrelated
to the Fabric network, it does not use the Membership Services Provider for
access control. Instead, the operations service relies entirely on mutual TLS with
client certificate authentication.

It is highly recommended to enable mutual TLS by setting the value of ``clientAuthRequired``
to ``true`` in production environments. With this configuration, clients are
required to provide a valid certificate for authentication. If the client does
not provide a certificate or the service cannot verify the client’s certificate,
the request is rejected. Note that if ``clientAuthRequired`` is set to ``false``,
clients do not need to provide a certificate; if they do, however, and the service
cannot verify the certificate, then the request will be rejected.

When TLS is disabled, authorization is bypassed and any client that can
connect to the operations endpoint will be able to use the API.

Metrics
^^^^^^^^^

The Fabric CA exposes metrics that can provide insight into the behavior of the system.
Operators and administrators can use this information to better understand how the system
is performing over time.

Configuring Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fabric CA provides two ways to expose metrics: a **pull** model based on Prometheus
and a **push** model based on StatsD.

Prometheus
^^^^^^^^^^^

A typical Prometheus deployment scrapes metrics by requesting them from an HTTP
endpoint exposed by instrumented targets. As Prometheus is responsible for
requesting the metrics, it is considered a pull system.

When configured, a Fabric CA Server will present a ``/metrics`` resource
on the operations service. To enable Prometheus, set the provider value in the
server's configuration file to ``prometheus``.

.. code:: yaml

  metrics:
    provider: prometheus

StatsD
^^^^^^^

StatsD is a simple statistics aggregation daemon. Metrics are sent to a
``statsd`` daemon where they are collected, aggregated, and pushed to a backend
for visualization and alerting. As this model requires instrumented processes
to send metrics data to StatsD, this is considered a push system.

The CA Server can be configured to send metrics to StatsD by setting the metrics
provider to ``statsd`` in the ``metrics`` section in servers' configuration filel. The ``statsd``
subsection must also be configured with the address of the StatsD daemon, the
network type to use (``tcp`` or ``udp``), and how often to send the metrics. An
optional ``prefix`` may be specified to help differentiate the source of the
metrics --- for example, differentiating metrics coming from separate servers ---
that would be prepended to all generated metrics.

.. code:: yaml

  metrics:
    provider: statsd
    statsd:
      network: udp
      address: 127.0.0.1:8125
      writeInterval: 10s
      prefix: server-0

For a look at the different metrics that are generated, check out
:doc:`metrics_reference`.

.. _client:

Fabric CA Client
----------------

This section describes how to use the fabric-ca-client command.

The Fabric CA client's home directory is determined as follows:
  - if the --home command line option is set, use its value
  - otherwise, if the ``FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME`` environment variable is set, use
    its value
  - otherwise, if the ``FABRIC_CA_HOME`` environment variable is set,
    use its value
  - otherwise, if the ``CA_CFG_PATH`` environment variable is set, use
    its value
  - otherwise, use ``$HOME/.fabric-ca-client``

The instructions below assume that the client configuration file exists
in the client's home directory.

Enrolling the bootstrap identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, if needed, customize the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) section
in the client configuration file. Note that ``csr.cn`` field must be set
to the ID of the bootstrap identity. Default CSR values are shown below:

.. code:: yaml

    csr:
      cn: <<enrollment ID>>
      key:
        algo: ecdsa
        size: 256
      names:
        - C: US
          ST: North Carolina
          L:
          O: Hyperledger Fabric
          OU: Fabric CA
      hosts:
       - <<hostname of the fabric-ca-client>>
      ca:
        pathlen:
        pathlenzero:
        expiry:

See `CSR fields <#csr-fields>`__ for description of the fields.

Then run ``fabric-ca-client enroll`` command to enroll the identity. For example,
following command enrolls an identity whose ID is **admin** and password is **adminpw**
by calling Fabric CA server that is running locally at 7054 port.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$HOME/fabric-ca/clients/admin
    fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7054

The enroll command stores an enrollment certificate (ECert), corresponding private key and CA
certificate chain PEM files in the subdirectories of the Fabric CA client's ``msp`` directory.
You will see messages indicating where the PEM files are stored.

Registering a new identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The identity performing the register request must be currently enrolled, and
must also have the proper authority to register the type of the identity that is being
registered.

In particular, three authorization checks are made by the Fabric CA server
during registration as follows:

1. The registrar (i.e. the invoker) must have the "hf.Registrar.Roles" attribute with a
   comma-separated list of values where one of the values equals the type of
   identity being registered; for example, if the registrar has the
   "hf.Registrar.Roles" attribute with a value of "peer", the registrar
   can register identities of type peer, but not client, admin, or orderer.

2. The affiliation of the registrar must be equal to or a prefix of
   the affiliation of the identity being registered.  For example, an registrar
   with an affiliation of "a.b" may register an identity with an affiliation
   of "a.b.c" but may not register an identity with an affiliation of "a.c".
   If root affiliation is required for an identity, then the affiliation request
   should be a dot (".") and the registrar must also have root affiliation.
   If no affiliation is specified in the registration request, the identity being
   registered will be given the affiliation of the registrar.

3. The registrar can register an identity with attributes if all of the following conditions
   are satisfied:

   - Registrar can register Fabric CA reserved attributes that have the prefix 'hf.'
     only if the registrar possesses the attribute and it is part of the value of the
     hf.Registrar.Attributes' attribute. Furthermore, if the attribute is of type list
     then the value of attribute being registered must be equal to or a subset of the
     value that the registrar has. If the attribute is of type boolean, the registrar
     can register the attribute only if the registrar's value for the attribute is 'true'.
   - Registering custom attributes (i.e. any attribute whose name does not begin with 'hf.')
     requires that the registrar has the 'hf.Registar.Attributes' attribute with the value of
     the attribute or pattern being registered. The only supported pattern is a string with
     a "*" at the end. For example, "a.b.*" is a pattern which matches all attribute names
     beginning with "a.b.". For example, if the registrar has hf.Registrar.Attributes=orgAdmin,
     then the only attribute which the registrar can add or remove from an identity is the
     'orgAdmin' attribute.
   - If the requested attribute name is 'hf.Registrar.Attributes', an additional
     check is performed to see if the requested values for this attribute are equal
     to or a subset of the registrar's values for 'hf.Registrar.Attributes'. For this
     to be true, each requested value must match a value in the registrar's value for
     'hf.Registrar.Attributes' attribute. For example, if the registrar's value for
     'hf.Registrar.Attributes' is 'a.b.*, x.y.z' and the requested attribute
     value is 'a.b.c, x.y.z', it is valid because 'a.b.c' matches 'a.b.*' and 'x.y.z'
     matches the registrar's 'x.y.z' value.

Examples:
   Valid Scenarios:
      1. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Attributes = a.b.*, x.y.z' and
         is registering attribute 'a.b.c', it is valid 'a.b.c' matches 'a.b.*'.
      2. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Attributes = a.b.*, x.y.z' and
         is registering attribute 'x.y.z', it is valid because 'x.y.z' matches the registrar's
         'x.y.z' value.
      3. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Attributes = a.b.*, x.y.z' and
         the requested attribute value is 'a.b.c, x.y.z', it is valid because 'a.b.c' matches
         'a.b.*' and 'x.y.z' matches the registrar's 'x.y.z' value.
      4. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Roles = peer,client,admin,orderer' and
         the requested attribute value is 'peer', 'peer,client,admin,orderer', or 'client,admin',
         it is valid because the requested value is equal to or a subset of the registrar's value.

   Invalid Scenarios:
      1. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Attributes = a.b.*, x.y.z' and
         is registering attribute 'hf.Registar.Attributes = a.b.c, x.y.*', it is invalid
         because requested attribute 'x.y.*' is not a pattern owned by the registrar. The value
         'x.y.*' is a superset of 'x.y.z'.
      2. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Attributes = a.b.*, x.y.z' and
         is registering attribute 'hf.Registar.Attributes = a.b.c, x.y.z, attr1', it is invalid
         because the registrar's 'hf.Registrar.Attributes' attribute values do not contain 'attr1'.
      3. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Attributes = a.b.*, x.y.z' and
         is registering attribute 'a.b', it is invalid because the value 'a.b' is not contained in
         'a.b.*'.
      4. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Attributes = a.b.*, x.y.z' and
         is registering attribute 'x.y', it is invalid because 'x.y' is not contained by 'x.y.z'.
      5. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Registrar.Roles = peer' and
         the requested attribute value is 'peer,client', it is invalid because
         the registrar does not have the client role in its value of hf.Registrar.Roles
         attribute.
      6. If the registrar has the attribute 'hf.Revoker = false' and the requested attribute
         value is 'true', it is invalid because the hf.Revoker attribute is a boolean attribute
         and the registrar's value for the attribute is not 'true'.

The table below lists all the attributes that can be registered for an identity.
The names of attributes are case sensitive.

+-----------------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| hf.IntermediateCA           | Boolean    | Identity is able to enroll as an intermediate CA if attribute value is true                                |
+-----------------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note: When registering an identity, you specify an array of attribute names and values. If the array
specifies multiple array elements with the same name, only the last element is currently used. In other words,
multi-valued attributes are not currently supported.

The following command uses the **admin** identity's credentials to register a new
identity with an enrollment id of "admin2", an affiliation of
"org1.department1", an attribute named "hf.Revoker" with a value of "true", and
an attribute named "admin" with a value of "true".  The ":ecert" suffix means that
by default the "admin" attribute and its value will be inserted into the identity's
enrollment certificate, which can then be used to make access control decisions.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$HOME/fabric-ca/clients/admin
    fabric-ca-client register --id.name admin2 --id.affiliation org1.department1 --id.attrs 'hf.Revoker=true,admin=true:ecert'

The password, also known as the enrollment secret, is printed.
This password is required to enroll the identity.
This allows an administrator to register an identity and give the
enrollment ID and the secret to someone else to enroll the identity.

Multiple attributes can be specified as part of the --id.attrs flag, each
attribute must be comma separated. For an attribute value that contains a comma,
the attribute must be encapsulated in double quotes. See example below.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name admin2 --id.affiliation org1.department1 --id.attrs '"hf.Registrar.Roles=peer,client",hf.Revoker=true'

or

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name admin2 --id.affiliation org1.department1 --id.attrs '"hf.Registrar.Roles=peer,client"' --id.attrs hf.Revoker=true

You may set default values for any of the fields used in the register command
by editing the client's configuration file.  For example, suppose the configuration
file contains the following:

.. code:: yaml

    id:
      name:
      type: client
      affiliation: org1.department1
      maxenrollments: -1
      attributes:
        - name: hf.Revoker
          value: true
        - name: anotherAttrName
          value: anotherAttrValue

The following command would then register a new identity with an enrollment id of
"admin3" which it takes from the command line, and the remainder is taken from the
configuration file including the identity type: "client", affiliation: "org1.department1",
and two attributes: "hf.Revoker" and "anotherAttrName".

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$HOME/fabric-ca/clients/admin
    fabric-ca-client register --id.name admin3

To register an identity with multiple attributes requires specifying all attribute names and values
in the configuration file as shown above.

Setting `maxenrollments` to 0 or leaving it out from the configuration will result in the identity
being registered to use the CA's max enrollment value. Furthermore, the max enrollment value for
an identity being registered cannot exceed the CA's max enrollment value. For example, if the CA's
max enrollment value is 5. Any new identity must have a value less than or equal to 5, and also
can't set it to -1 (infinite enrollments).

Next, let's register a peer identity which will be used to enroll the peer in the following section.
The following command registers the **peer1** identity.  Note that we choose to specify our own
password (or secret) rather than letting the server generate one for us.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$HOME/fabric-ca/clients/admin
    fabric-ca-client register --id.name peer1 --id.type peer --id.affiliation org1.department1 --id.secret peer1pw

Note that affiliations are case sensitive except for the non-leaf affiliations that are specified in
the server configuration file, which are always stored in lower case. For example, if the affiliations
section of the server configuration file looks like this:

.. code:: bash

    affiliations:
      BU1:
        Department1:
          - Team1
      BU2:
        - Department2
        - Department3

`BU1`, `Department1`, `BU2` are stored in lower case. This is because Fabric CA uses Viper to read configuration.
Viper treats map keys as case insensitive and always returns lowercase value. To register an identity with
`Team1` affiliation, `bu1.department1.Team1` would need to be specified to the
`--id.affiliation` flag as shown below:

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$HOME/fabric-ca/clients/admin
    fabric-ca-client register --id.name client1 --id.type client --id.affiliation bu1.department1.Team1

Enrolling a peer identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have successfully registered a peer identity, you may now
enroll the peer given the enrollment ID and secret (i.e. the *password*
from the previous section).  This is similar to enrolling the bootstrap identity
except that we also demonstrate how to use the "-M" option to populate the
Hyperledger Fabric MSP (Membership Service Provider) directory structure.

The following command enrolls peer1.
Be sure to replace the value of the "-M" option with the path to your
peer's MSP directory which is the
'mspConfigPath' setting in the peer's core.yaml file.
You may also set the FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME to the home directory of your peer.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$HOME/fabric-ca/clients/peer1
    fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://peer1:peer1pw@localhost:7054 -M $FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME/msp

Enrolling an orderer is the same, except the path to the MSP directory is
the 'LocalMSPDir' setting in your orderer's orderer.yaml file.

All enrollment certificates issued by the fabric-ca-server have organizational
units (or "OUs" for short) as follows:

1. The root of the OU hierarchy equals the identity type
2. An OU is added for each component of the identity's affiliation

For example, if an identity is of type `peer` and its affiliation is
`department1.team1`, the identity's OU hierarchy (from leaf to root) is
`OU=team1, OU=department1, OU=peer`.

Getting Identity Mixer credential
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Identity Mixer (Idemix) is a cryptographic protocol suite for privacy-preserving authentication and transfer of certified attributes.
Idemix allows clients to authenticate with verifiers without the involvement of the issuer (CA) and selectively disclose only those attributes
that are required by the verifier and can do so without being linkable across their transactions.

Fabric CA server can issue Idemix credentials in addition to X509 certificates. An Idemix credential can be requested by sending the request to
the ``/api/v1/idemix/credential`` API endpoint. For more information on this and other Fabric CA server API endpoints, please refer to
`swagger-fabric-ca.json <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/master/swagger/swagger-fabric-ca.json>`_.

The Idemix credential issuance is a two step process. First, send a request with an empty body to the ``/api/v1/idemix/credential``
API endpoint to get a nonce and CA's Idemix public key. Second, create a credential request using the nonce and CA's Idemix public key and
send another request with the credential request in the body to  the ``/api/v1/idemix/credential`` API endpoint to get an Idemix credential,
Credential Revocation Information (CRI), and attribute names and values. Currently, only three attributes are supported:

- **OU** - organization unit of the identity. The value of this attribute is set to identity's affiliation. For example, if identity's affiliation is `dept1.unit1`, then OU attribute is set to `dept1.unit1`
- **IsAdmin** - if the identity is an admin or not. The value of this attribute is set to the value of `isAdmin` registration attribute.
- **EnrollmentID** - enrollment ID of the identity

You can refer to the `handleIdemixEnroll` function in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/master/lib/client.go for reference implementation
of the two step process for getting Idemix credential.

The ``/api/v1/idemix/credential`` API endpoint accepts both basic and token authorization headers. The basic authorization header should
contain User's registration ID and password. If the identity already has X509 enrollment certificate, it can also be used to create a token authorization header.

Note that Hyperledger Fabric will support clients to sign transactions with both X509 and Idemix credentials, but will only support X509 credentials
for peer and orderer identities. As before, applications can use a Fabric SDK to send requests to the Fabric CA server. SDKs hide the complexity
associated with creating authorization header and request payload, and with processing the response.

Getting Idemix CRI (Certificate Revocation Information)
-------------------------------------------------------
An Idemix CRI (Credential Revocation Information) is similar in purpose to an X509 CRL (Certificate Revocation List):
to revoke what was previously issued.  However, there are some differences.

In X509, the issuer revokes an end user's certificate and its ID is included in the CRL.
The verifier checks to see if the user's certificate is in the CRL and if so, returns an authorization failure.
The end user is not involved in this revocation process, other than receiving an authorization error from a verifier.

In Idemix, the end user is involved.  The issuer revokes an end user's credential similar to X509 and evidence of this
revocation is recorded in the CRI.  The CRI is given to the end user (aka "prover").  The end user then generates a
proof that their credential has not been revoked according to the CRI.  The end user gives this proof to the verifier
who verifies the proof according to the CRI.
For verification to succeed, the version of the CRI (known as the "epoch") used by the end user and verifier must be same.
The latest CRI can be requested by sending a request to ``/api/v1/idemix/cri`` API endpoint.

The version of the CRI is incremented when an enroll request is received by the fabric-ca-server and there are no revocation
handles remaining in the revocation handle pool. In this case, the fabric-ca-server must generate a new pool of revocation
handles which increments the epoch of the CRI. The number of revocation handles in the revocation handle pool is configurable
via the ``idemix.rhpoolsize`` server configuration property.

Reenrolling an identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose your enrollment certificate is about to expire or has been compromised.
You can issue the reenroll command to renew your enrollment certificate as follows.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$HOME/fabric-ca/clients/peer1
    fabric-ca-client reenroll

Revoking a certificate or identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An identity or a certificate can be revoked. Revoking an identity will revoke all
the certificates owned by the identity and will also prevent the identity from getting
any new certificates. Revoking a certificate will invalidate a single certificate.

In order to revoke a certificate or an identity, the calling identity must have
the ``hf.Revoker`` and ``hf.Registrar.Roles`` attribute. The revoking identity
can only revoke a certificate or an identity that has an affiliation that is
equal to or prefixed by the revoking identity's affiliation. Furthermore, the
revoker can only revoke identities with types that are listed in the revoker's
``hf.Registrar.Roles`` attribute.

For example, a revoker with affiliation **orgs.org1** and 'hf.Registrar.Roles=peer,client'
attribute can revoke either a **peer** or **client** type identity affiliated with
**orgs.org1** or **orgs.org1.department1** but can't revoke an identity affiliated with
**orgs.org2** or of any other type.

The following command disables an identity and revokes all of the certificates
associated with the identity. All future requests received by the Fabric CA server
from this identity will be rejected.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client revoke -e <enrollment_id> -r <reason>

The following are the supported reasons that can be specified using ``-r`` flag:

  1. unspecified
  2. keycompromise
  3. cacompromise
  4. affiliationchange
  5. superseded
  6. cessationofoperation
  7. certificatehold
  8. removefromcrl
  9. privilegewithdrawn
  10. aacompromise

For example, the bootstrap admin who is associated with root of the affiliation tree
can revoke **peer1**'s identity as follows:

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$HOME/fabric-ca/clients/admin
    fabric-ca-client revoke -e peer1

An enrollment certificate that belongs to an identity can be revoked by
specifying its AKI (Authority Key Identifier) and serial number as follows:

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client revoke -a xxx -s yyy -r <reason>

For example, you can get the AKI and the serial number of a certificate using the openssl command
and pass them to the ``revoke`` command to revoke the said certificate as follows:

.. code:: bash

   serial=$(openssl x509 -in userecert.pem -serial -noout | cut -d "=" -f 2)
   aki=$(openssl x509 -in userecert.pem -text | awk '/keyid/ {gsub(/ *keyid:|:/,"",$1);print tolower($0)}')
   fabric-ca-client revoke -s $serial -a $aki -r affiliationchange

The `--gencrl` flag can be used to generate a CRL (Certificate Revocation List) that contains all the revoked
certificates. For example, following command will revoke the identity **peer1**, generates a CRL and stores
it in the **<msp folder>/crls/crl.pem** file.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client revoke -e peer1 --gencrl

A CRL can also be generated using the `gencrl` command. Refer to the `Generating a CRL (Certificate Revocation List)`_
section for more information on the `gencrl` command.

Generating a CRL (Certificate Revocation List)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After a certificate is revoked in the Fabric CA server, the appropriate MSPs in Hyperledger Fabric must also be updated.
This includes both local MSPs of the peers as well as MSPs in the appropriate channel configuration blocks.
To do this, PEM encoded CRL (certificate revocation list) file must be placed in the `crls`
folder of the MSP. The ``fabric-ca-client gencrl`` command can be used to generate a CRL. Any identity
with ``hf.GenCRL`` attribute can create a CRL that contains serial numbers of all certificates that were revoked
during a certain period. The created CRL is stored in the `<msp folder>/crls/crl.pem` file.

The following command will create a CRL containing all the revoked certficates (expired and unexpired) and
store the CRL in the `~/msp/crls/crl.pem` file.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=~/clientconfig
    fabric-ca-client gencrl -M ~/msp

The next command will create a CRL containing all certificates (expired and unexpired) that were revoked after
2017-09-13T16:39:57-08:00 (specified by the `--revokedafter` flag) and before 2017-09-21T16:39:57-08:00
(specified by the `--revokedbefore` flag) and store the CRL in the `~/msp/crls/crl.pem` file.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=~/clientconfig
    fabric-ca-client gencrl --caname "" --revokedafter 2017-09-13T16:39:57-08:00 --revokedbefore 2017-09-21T16:39:57-08:00 -M ~/msp


The `--caname` flag specifies the name of the CA to which this request is sent. In this example, the gencrl request is
sent to the default CA.

The `--revokedafter` and `--revokedbefore` flags specify the lower and upper boundaries of a time period.
The generated CRL will contain certificates that were revoked in this time period. The values must be UTC
timestamps specified in RFC3339 format. The `--revokedafter` timestamp cannot be greater than the
`--revokedbefore` timestamp.

By default, 'Next Update' date of the CRL is set to next day. The `crl.expiry` CA configuration property
can be used to specify a custom value.

The gencrl command will also accept `--expireafter` and `--expirebefore` flags that can be used to generate a CRL
with revoked certificates that expire during the period specified by these flags. For example, the following command
will generate a CRL that contains certificates that were revoked after 2017-09-13T16:39:57-08:00 and
before 2017-09-21T16:39:57-08:00, and that expire after 2017-09-13T16:39:57-08:00 and before 2018-09-13T16:39:57-08:00

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=~/clientconfig
    fabric-ca-client gencrl --caname "" --expireafter 2017-09-13T16:39:57-08:00 --expirebefore 2018-09-13T16:39:57-08:00  --revokedafter 2017-09-13T16:39:57-08:00 --revokedbefore 2017-09-21T16:39:57-08:00 -M ~/msp

Enabling TLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes in more detail how to configure TLS for a Fabric CA client.

The following sections may be configured in the ``fabric-ca-client-config.yaml``.

.. code:: yaml

    tls:
      # Enable TLS (default: false)
      enabled: true
      certfiles:
        - root.pem
      client:
        certfile: tls_client-cert.pem
        keyfile: tls_client-key.pem

The **certfiles** option is the set of root certificates trusted by the
client. This will typically just be the root Fabric CA server's
certificate found in the server's home directory in the **ca-cert.pem**
file.

The **client** option is required only if mutual TLS is configured on
the server.

Attribute-Based Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access control decisions can be made by chaincode (and by the Hyperledger Fabric runtime)
based upon an identity's attributes.  This is called
**Attribute-Based Access Control**, or **ABAC** for short.

In order to make this possible, an identity's enrollment certificate (ECert)
may contain one or more attribute name and value.  The chaincode then
extracts an attribute's value to make an access control decision.

For example, suppose that you are developing application *app1* and want a
particular chaincode operation to be accessible only by app1 administrators.
Your chaincode could verify that the caller's certificate (which was issued by
a CA trusted for the channel) contains an attribute named *app1Admin* with a
value of *true*.  Of course the name of the attribute can be anything and the
value need not be a boolean value.

So how do you get an enrollment certificate with an attribute?
There are two methods:

1.   When you register an identity, you can specify that an enrollment certificate
     issued for the identity should by default contain an attribute.  This behavior
     can be overridden at enrollment time, but this is useful for establishing
     default behavior and, assuming registration occurs outside of your application,
     does not require any application change.

     The following shows how to register *user1* with two attributes:
     *app1Admin* and *email*.
     The ":ecert" suffix causes the *appAdmin* attribute to be inserted into user1's
     enrollment certificate by default, when the user does not explicitly request
     attributes at enrollment time.  The *email* attribute is not added
     to the enrollment certificate by default.

.. code:: bash

     fabric-ca-client register --id.name user1 --id.secret user1pw --id.type client --id.affiliation org1 --id.attrs 'app1Admin=true:ecert,email=user1@gmail.com'

2. When you enroll an identity, you may explicitly request that one or more attributes
   be added to the certificate.
   For each attribute requested, you may specify whether the attribute is
   optional or not.  If it is not requested optionally and the identity does
   not possess the attribute, an error will occur.

   The following shows how to enroll *user1* with the *email* attribute,
   without the *app1Admin* attribute, and optionally with the *phone*
   attribute (if the user possesses the *phone* attribute).

.. code:: bash

   fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://user1:user1pw@localhost:7054 --enrollment.attrs "email,phone:opt"

The table below shows the three attributes which are automatically registered for every identity.

===================================   =====================================
     Attribute Name                               Attribute Value
===================================   =====================================
  hf.EnrollmentID                        The enrollment ID of the identity
  hf.Type                                The type of the identity
  hf.Affiliation                         The affiliation of the identity
===================================   =====================================

To add any of the above attributes **by default** to a certificate, you must
explicitly register the attribute with the ":ecert" specification.
For example, the following registers identity 'user1' so that
the 'hf.Affiliation' attribute will be added to an enrollment certificate if
no specific attributes are requested at enrollment time.  Note that the
value of the affiliation (which is 'org1') must be the same in both the
'--id.affiliation' and the '--id.attrs' flags.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client register --id.name user1 --id.secret user1pw --id.type client --id.affiliation org1 --id.attrs 'hf.Affiliation=org1:ecert'

For information on the chaincode library API for Attribute-Based Access Control,
see `https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/chaincode/lib/cid/README.md <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/chaincode/lib/cid/README.md>`_

Dynamic Server Configuration Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to use fabric-ca-client to dynamically update portions
of the fabric-ca-server's configuration without restarting the server.

All commands in this section require that you first be enrolled by executing the
`fabric-ca-client enroll` command.

Dynamically updating identities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes how to use fabric-ca-client to dynamically update identities.

An authorization failure will occur if the client identity does not satisfy all of the following:

 - The client identity must possess the "hf.Registrar.Roles" attribute with a comma-separated list of
   values where one of the values equals the type of identity being updated; for example, if the client's
   identity has the "hf.Registrar.Roles" attribute with a value of "client", the client can update
   identities of type 'client', but not 'peer'.

 - The affiliation of the client's identity must be equal to or a prefix of the affiliation of the identity
   being updated.  For example, a client with an affiliation of "a.b" may update an identity with an affiliation
   of "a.b.c" but may not update an identity with an affiliation of "a.c". If root affiliation is required for an
   identity, then the update request should specify a dot (".") for the affiliation and the client must also have
   root affiliation.

The following shows how to add, modify, and remove an affiliation.

Getting Identity Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A caller may retrieve information on a identity from the fabric-ca server as long as the caller meets
the authorization requirements highlighted in the section above. The following command shows how to get an
identity.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity list --id user1

A caller may also request to retrieve information on all identities that it is authorized to see by
issuing the following command.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity list

Adding an identity
"""""""""""""""""""

The following adds a new identity for 'user1'. Adding a new identity performs the same action as registering an
identity via the 'fabric-ca-client register' command. There are two available methods for adding a new identity.
The first method is via the `--json` flag where you describe the identity in a JSON string.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity add user1 --json '{"secret": "user1pw", "type": "client", "affiliation": "org1", "max_enrollments": 1, "attrs": [{"name": "hf.Revoker", "value": "true"}]}'

The following adds a user with root affiliation. Note that an affiliation name of "." means the root affiliation.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity add user1 --json '{"secret": "user1pw", "type": "client", "affiliation": ".", "max_enrollments": 1, "attrs": [{"name": "hf.Revoker", "value": "true"}]}'

The second method for adding an identity is to use direct flags. See the example below for adding 'user1'.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity add user1 --secret user1pw --type client --affiliation . --maxenrollments 1 --attrs hf.Revoker=true

The table below lists all the fields of an identity and whether they are required or optional, and any default values they might have.

+----------------+------------+------------------------+
| Fields         | Required   | Default Value          |
+================+============+========================+
| ID             | Yes        |                        |
+----------------+------------+------------------------+
| Secret         | No         |                        |

Modifying an identity
""""""""""""""""""""""

There are two available methods for modifying an existing identity. The first method is via the `--json` flag where you describe
the modifications in to an identity in a JSON string. Multiple modifications can be made in a single request. Any element of an identity that
is not modified will retain its original value.

NOTE: A maxenrollments value of "-2" specifies that the CA's max enrollment setting is to be used.

The command below make multiple modification to an identity using the --json flag.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --json '{"secret": "newPassword", "affiliation": ".", "attrs": [{"name": "hf.Regisrar.Roles", "value": "peer,client"},{"name": "hf.Revoker", "value": "true"}]}'

The commands below make modifications using direct flags. The following updates the enrollment secret (or password) for identity 'user1' to 'newsecret'.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --secret newsecret

The following updates the affiliation of identity 'user1' to 'org2'.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --affiliation org2

The following updates the type of identity 'user1' to 'peer'.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --type peer


The following updates the maxenrollments of identity 'user1' to 5.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --maxenrollments 5

By specifying a maxenrollments value of '-2', the following causes identity 'user1' to use
the CA's max enrollment setting.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --maxenrollments -2

The following sets the value of the 'hf.Revoker' attribute for identity 'user1' to 'false'.
If the identity has other attributes, they are not changed.  If the identity did not previously
possess the 'hf.Revoker' attribute, the attribute is added to the identity. An attribute may
also be removed by specifying no value for the attribute.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --attrs hf.Revoker=false

The following removes the 'hf.Revoker' attribute for user 'user1'.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --attrs hf.Revoker=

The following demonstrates that multiple options may be used in a single `fabric-ca-client identity modify`
command. In this case, both the secret and the type are updated for user 'user1'.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity modify user1 --secret newpass --type peer

Removing an identity
"""""""""""""""""""""

The following removes identity 'user1' and also revokes any certificates associated with the 'user1' identity.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client identity remove user1

Note: Removal of identities is disabled in the fabric-ca-server by default, but may be enabled
by starting the fabric-ca-server with the `--cfg.identities.allowremove` option.

Dynamically updating affiliations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes how to use fabric-ca-client to dynamically update affiliations. The
following shows how to add, modify, remove, and list an affiliation.

Adding an affiliation
"""""""""""""""""""""""

An authorization failure will occur if the client identity does not satisfy all of the following:

  - The client identity must possess the attribute 'hf.AffiliationMgr' with a value of 'true'.
  - The affiliation of the client identity must be hierarchically above the affiliation being updated.
    For example, if the client's affiliation is "a.b", the client may add affiliation "a.b.c" but not
    "a" or "a.b".

The following adds a new affiliation named ‘org1.dept1’.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client affiliation add org1.dept1

Modifying an affiliation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

An authorization failure will occur if the client identity does not satisfy all of the following:

  - The client identity must possess the attribute 'hf.AffiliationMgr' with a value of 'true'.
  - The affiliation of the client identity must be hierarchically above the affiliation being updated.
    For example, if the client's affiliation is "a.b", the client may add affiliation "a.b.c" but not
    "a" or "a.b".
  - If the '--force' option is true and there are identities which must be modified, the client
    identity must also be authorized to modify the identity.

The following renames the 'org2' affiliation to 'org3'.  It also renames any sub affiliations
(e.g. 'org2.department1' is renamed to 'org3.department1').

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client affiliation modify org2 --name org3

If there are identities that are affected by the renaming of an affiliation, it will result in
an error unless the '--force' option is used. Using the '--force' option will update the affiliation
of identities that are affected to use the new affiliation name.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client affiliation modify org1 --name org2 --force

Removing an affiliation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

An authorization failure will occur if the client identity does not satisfy all of the following:

  - The client identity must possess the attribute 'hf.AffiliationMgr' with a value of 'true'.
  - The affiliation of the client identity must be hierarchically above the affiliation being updated.
    For example, if the client's affiliation is "a.b", the client may remove affiliation "a.b.c" but not
    "a" or "a.b".
  - If the '--force' option is true and there are identities which must be modified, the client
    identity must also be authorized to modify the identity.

The following removes affiliation 'org2' and also any sub affiliations.
For example, if 'org2.dept1' is an affiliation below 'org2', it is also removed.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client affiliation remove org2

If there are identities that are affected by the removing of an affiliation, it will result
in an error unless the '--force' option is used. Using the '--force' option will also remove
all identities that are associated with that affiliation, and the certificates associated with
any of these identities.

Note: Removal of affiliations is disabled in the fabric-ca-server by default, but may be enabled
by starting the fabric-ca-server with the `--cfg.affiliations.allowremove` option.

Listing affiliation information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An authorization failure will occur if the client identity does not satisfy all of the following:

  - The client identity must possess the attribute 'hf.AffiliationMgr' with a value of 'true'.
  - Affiliation of the client identity must be equal to or be hierarchically above the
    affiliation being updated. For example, if the client's affiliation is "a.b",
    the client may get affiliation information on "a.b" or "a.b.c" but not "a" or "a.c".

The following command shows how to get a specific affiliation.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client affiliation list --affiliation org2.dept1

A caller may also request to retrieve information on all affiliations that it is authorized to see by
issuing the following command.

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client affiliation list

Manage Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to use fabric-ca-client to manage certificates.

Listing certificate information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The certificates that are visible to a caller include:

  - Those certificates which belong to the caller
  - If the caller possesses the ``hf.Registrar.Roles`` attribute or the ``hf.Revoker`` attribute with a value of ``true``,
    all certificates which belong to identities in and below the caller's affiliation. For example, if the client's
    affiliation is ``a.b``, the client may get certificates for identities who's affiliation
    is ``a.b`` or ``a.b.c`` but not ``a`` or ``a.c``.

If executing a list command that requests certificates of more than one identity, only certificates of identities
with an affiliation that is equal to or hierarchically below the caller's affiliation will be listed.

The certificates which will be listed may be filtered based on ID, AKI, serial number, expiration time, revocation time, notrevoked, and notexpired flags.

* ``id``: List certificates for this enrollment ID
* ``serial``: List certificates that have this serial number
* ``aki``: List certificates that have this AKI
* ``expiration``: List certificates that have expiration dates that fall within this expiration time
* ``revocation``: List certificates that were revoked within this revocation time
* ``notrevoked``: List certificates that have not yet been revoked
* ``notexpired``: List certificates that have not yet expired

You can use flags ``notexpired`` and ``notrevoked`` as filters to exclude revoked certificates and/or expired certificates from the result set.
For example, if you only care about certificates that have expired but have not been revoked you can use the ``expiration`` and ``notrevoked`` flags to
get back such results. An example of this case is provided below.

Time should be specified based on RFC3339. For instance, to list certificates that have expirations between
March 1, 2018 at 1:00 PM and June 15, 2018 at 2:00 AM, the input time string would look like 2018-03-01T13:00:00z
and 2018-06-15T02:00:00z. If time is not a concern, and only the dates matter, then the time part can be left
off and then the strings become 2018-03-01 and 2018-06-15.

The string ``now`` may be used to denote the current time and the empty string to denote any time. For example, ``now::`` denotes
a time range from now to any time in the future, and ``::now`` denotes a time range from any time in the past until now.

The following command shows how to list certificates using various filters.

List all certificates:

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list

List all certificates by id:

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin

List certificate by serial and aki:

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --serial 1234 --aki 1234

List certificate by id and serial/aki:

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --serial 1234 --aki 1234

List certificates that are neither revoker nor expired by id:

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --notrevoked --notexpired

List all certificates that have not been revoked for an id (admin):

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --notrevoked

List all certificates have not expired for an id (admin):

The "--notexpired" flag is equivalent to "--expiration now::", which means certificates
will expire some time in the future.

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --notexpired

List all certificates that were revoked between a time range for an id (admin):

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --revocation 2018-01-01T01:30:00z::2018-01-30T05:00:00z

List all certificates that were revoked between a time range but have not expired for an id (admin):

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --revocation 2018-01-01::2018-01-30 --notexpired

List all revoked certificates using duration (revoked between 30 days and 15 days ago) for an id (admin):

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --revocation -30d::-15d

List all revoked certificates before a time

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --revocation ::2018-01-30

List all revoked certificates after a time

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --revocation 2018-01-30::

List all revoked certificates before now and after a certain date

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --revocation 2018-01-30::now

List all certificate that expired between a time range but have not been revoked for an id (admin):

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --expiration 2018-01-01::2018-01-30 --notrevoked

List all expired certificates using duration (expired between 30 days and 15 days ago) for an id (admin):

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --expiration -30d::-15d

List all certificates that have expired or will expire before a certain time

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --expiration ::2058-01-30

List all certificates that have expired or will expire after a certain time

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --expiration 2018-01-30::

List all expired certificates before now and after a certain date

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --expiration 2018-01-30::now

List certificates expiring in the next 10 days:

.. code:: bash

 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --expiration ::+10d --notrevoked

The list certificate command can also be used to store certificates on the file
system. This is a convenient way to populate the admins folder in an MSP, The "-store" flag
points to the location on the file system to store the certificates.

Configure an identity to be an admin, by storing certificates for an identity
in the MSP:

.. code:: bash

 export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/clientHome
 fabric-ca-client certificate list --id admin --store msp/admincerts

Contact specific CA instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a server is running multiple CA instances, requests can be directed to a
specific CA. By default, if no CA name is specified in the client request the
request will be directed to the default CA on the fabric-ca server. A CA name
can be specified on the command line of a client command using the ``caname``
filter as follows:

.. code:: bash

    fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7054 --caname <caname>

Configuring an HSM
------------------
By default, the Fabric CA server and client store private keys in a PEM-encoded file,
but they can also be configured to store private keys in an HSM (Hardware Security Module)
via PKCS11 APIs. This behavior is configured in the BCCSP (BlockChain Crypto Service Provider)
section of the server’s or client’s configuration file. Currently, Fabric only
supports the PKCS11 standard to communicate with an HSM.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example demonstrates how to configure the Fabric CA server or
client to use a software version of PKCS11 called SoftHSM (see https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2).

After installing SoftHSM, make sure to set your SOFTHSM2_CONF environment variable to
point to the location where the SoftHSM2 configuration file is stored. The config file looks like

.. code::

  directories.tokendir = /tmp/
  objectstore.backend = file
  log.level = INFO

You can find example configuration file named SoftHSM2.conf under testdata directory.

Create a token, label it “ForFabric”, set the pin to ‘98765432’
(refer to SoftHSM documentation).

You can use both the config file and environment variables to configure BCCSP.
For example, set the bccsp section of Fabric CA server configuration file as follows.
Note that the default field’s value is PKCS11.

.. code:: yaml

  #############################################################################
  # BCCSP (BlockChain Crypto Service Provider) section is used to select which
  # crypto library implementation to use
  #############################################################################
  bccsp:
    default: PKCS11
    pkcs11:
      Library: /usr/local/Cellar/softhsm/2.1.0/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so
      Pin: 98765432
      Label: ForFabric
      hash: SHA2
      security: 256
      filekeystore:
        # The directory used for the software file-based keystore
        keystore: msp/keystore

And you can override relevant fields via environment variables as follows:

.. code:: bash

  FABRIC_CA_SERVER_BCCSP_DEFAULT=PKCS11
  FABRIC_CA_SERVER_BCCSP_PKCS11_LIBRARY=/usr/local/Cellar/softhsm/2.1.0/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so
  FABRIC_CA_SERVER_BCCSP_PKCS11_PIN=98765432
  FABRIC_CA_SERVER_BCCSP_PKCS11_LABEL=ForFabric


The prebuilt Hyperledger Fabric Docker images are not enabled to use PKCS11. If
you are deploying the Fabric CA using Docker, you need to build your own image
and enable PKCS11 using the following command:

.. code:: bash

  make docker GO_TAGS=pkcs11

You also need to ensure that the PKCS11 library is available to be used by the
CA by installing it or mounting it inside the container. If you are deploying
your Fabric CA using Docker Compose, you can update your Compose files to mount
the SoftHSM library and configuration file inside the container using volumes.
As an example, you would add the following environment and volumes variables to
your Docker Compose file:

.. code::

  environment:
     - SOFTHSM2_CONF=/etc/hyperledger/fabric/config.file
  volumes:
     - /home/softhsm/config.file:/etc/hyperledger/fabric/config.file
     - /usr/local/Cellar/softhsm/2.1.0/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so:/etc/hyperledger/fabric/libsofthsm2.so

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. If you see a ``Killed: 9`` error on OSX when trying to execute
   ``fabric-ca-client`` or ``fabric-ca-server``, there is a long thread
   describing this problem at https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19734.
   The short answer is that to work around this issue, you can run the
   following command::

    # sudo ln -s /usr/bin/true /usr/local/bin/dsymutil

2. The error ``[ERROR] No certificates found for provided serial and aki`` will occur
   if the following sequence of events occurs:

   a. You issue a `fabric-ca-client enroll` command, creating an enrollment certificate (i.e. an ECert).
      This stores a copy of the ECert in the fabric-ca-server's database.
   b. The fabric-ca-server's database is deleted and recreated, thus losing the ECert from step 'a'.
      For example, this may happen if you stop and restart a Docker container hosting the fabric-ca-server,
      but your fabric-ca-server is using the default sqlite database and the database file is not stored
      on a volume and is therefore not persistent.
   c. You issue a `fabric-ca-client register` command or any other command which tries to use the ECert from
      step 'a'.  In this case, since the database no longer contains the ECert, the
      ``[ERROR] No certificates found for provided serial and aki`` will occur.

   To resolve this error, you must enroll again by repeating step 'a'.  This will issue a new ECert
   which will be stored in the current database.

3. When sending multiple parallel requests to a Fabric CA Server cluster that uses shared sqlite3 databases,
   the server occasionally returns a 'database locked' error. This is most probably because the database
   transaction timed out while waiting for database lock (held by another cluster member) to be released.
   This is an invalid configuration because sqlite is an embedded database, which means the Fabric CA server
   cluster must share the same file via a shared file system, which introduces a SPoF (single point of failure),
   which contradicts the purpose of cluster topology. The best practice is to use either Postgres or MySQL
   databases in a cluster topology.

4. Suppose an error similar to
   ``Failed to deserialize creator identity, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority``
   is returned by a peer or orderer when using an enrollment certificate issued by the Fabric CA Server.  This indicates that
   the signing CA certificate used by the Fabric CA Server to issue certificates does not match a certificate in the `cacerts` or `intermediatecerts`
   folder of the MSP used to make authorization checks.

   The MSP which is used to make authorization checks depends on which operation you were performing when the error occurred.
   For example, if you were trying to install chaincode on a peer, the local MSP on the file system of the peer is used;
   otherwise, if you were performing some channel specific operation such as instantiating chaincode on a specific channel,
   the MSP in the genesis block or the most recent configuration block of the channel is used.

   To confirm that this is the problem, compare the AKI (Authority Key Identifier) of the enrollment certificate
   to the SKI (Subject Key Identifier) of the certificate(s) in the `cacerts` and `intermediatecerts` folder of appropriate MSP.
   The command `openssl x509 -in <PEM-file> -noout -text | grep -A1 "Authority Key Identifier"` will display the AKI and
   `openssl x509 -in <PEM-file> -noout -text | grep -A1 "Subject Key Identifier"` will display the SKI.
   If they are not equal, you have confirmed that this is the cause of the error.

   This can happen for multiple reasons including:

   a. You used `cryptogen` to generate your key material but did not start `fabric-ca-server` with the signing key and certificate generated
      by `cryptogen`.

      To resolve (assuming `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME` is set to the home directory of your `fabric-ca-server`):

      1. Stop `fabric-ca-server`.
      2. Copy `crypto-config/peerOrganizations/<orgName>/ca/*pem` to `$FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME/ca-cert.pem`.
      3. Copy `crypto-config/peerOrganizations/<orgName>/ca/*_sk` to `$FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME/msp/keystore/`.
      4. Start `fabric-ca-server`.
      5. Delete any previously issued enrollment certificates and get new certificates by enrolling again.

   b. You deleted and recreated the CA signing key and certificate used by the Fabric CA Server after generating the genesis block.
      This can happen if the Fabric CA Server is running in a Docker container, the container was restarted, and its home directory
      is not on a volume mount.  In this case, the Fabric CA Server will create a new CA signing key and certificate.

      Assuming that you can not recover the original CA signing key, the only way to recover from this scenario is to update the
      certificate in the `cacerts` (or `intermediatecerts`) of the appropriate MSPs to the new CA certificate.
