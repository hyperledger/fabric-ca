Fabric CA Operation's Guide
============================

This guide will illustrate how to use Fabric CA to setup
a Fabric network. All identities that participate on a Hyperledger Fabric
blockchain network must be authorized. This authorization
is provided in the form of cryptographic material that is
verified against trusted authorities.

In this guide, you will see the process for setting up a
blockchain network that includes two organizations, each with two peers
and an orderer. You'll see how to generate cryptographic material for orderers,
peers, administrators, and end users so that private keys never leave
the host or container where they are generated.

Topology
---------

In this example, we will look at how to setup up an orderer, peers, and CAs
across three organizations. The topology of this deployment can be seen in the
image below:

.. image:: ./images/network_topology.png

This example will simulate a deployment using docker containers. The
containers will be treated as if they are running on different host machines.
This is done so that you can see which assets need to be exchanged out-of-band
between the parties involved in the network.

The network configuration for docker assumes that all containers are running in
the same network. If your deployment is spread across different networks, the
example will be need to be adjusted to work with your network configurations.

The documentation below breaks down the docker-compose file to talk about individual
components. To see the entire docker-compose, click :doc:`here <docker_compose>`.

Setup CAs
----------

Download fabric-ca-client binary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each host that needs to acquire cryptographic material, you will need to have the
fabric-ca-client binary available on the host machine. The client will be used to
connect to the Fabric CA server container.

To download the fabric-ca-client binary, browse to this  `repository <https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric-ca/hyperledger-fabric-ca/>`_ and
select the latest binary for your machine.


.. note:: This example is using version 1.4.0 of fabric-ca-client.

Setup TLS CA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A TLS CA is used to issue TLS certificates.  These certificates are required in
order to secure the communication between various processes.

In order to simplify this example, all organizations will use the same TLS CA
and TLS mutual authentication is disabled.

.. note:: In a production environment, you will probably use your organization's CA
          to get TLS certificates. You will have to transfer out-of-band your CA's
          certificate with organizations that will validate your TLS certificates.

A docker service, such as the one below can be used to a launch a Fabric TLS CA
container.

.. code:: yaml

  ca-tls:
    container_name: ca-tls
    image: hyperledger/fabric-ca
    command: sh -c 'fabric-ca-server start -d -b tls-ca-admin:tls-ca-adminpw --port 7052'
    environment:
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/fabric-ca/crypto
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_ENABLED=true
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CSR_CN=ca-tls
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CSR_HOSTS=0.0.0.0
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_DEBUG=true
    volumes:
      - /tmp/hyperledger/tls/ca:/tmp/hyperledger/fabric-ca
    networks:
      - fabric-ca
    ports:
      - 7052:7052

This container can be started using the following docker command.

.. code:: bash

    docker-compose up ca-tls

On a successful launch of the container, you will see the following line in
the CA container's log.

.. code:: bash

   [INFO] Listening on https://0.0.0.0:7052

At this point the TLA CA server is on a listening on a secure socket, and can start
issuing TLS certificates.

Enroll TLS CA's Admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can start using the CA client, you must acquire the signing
certificate for the CA's TLS certificate. This is a required step before you
can connect using TLS.

In our example, you would need to acquire the file located at ``/tmp/hyperledger/tls/ca/crypto/ca-cert.pem``
on the machine running the TLS CA server and copy this file over to the host where
you will be running the CA client binary. This certificate, also known as the TLS
CA's signing certificate is going to be used to validate the TLS certificate of
the CA. Once the certificate has been copied over to the CA client's host
machine, you can start issuing commands using the CA.

The TLS CA's signing certificate will need to be available on each host that will run
commands against the TLS CA.

The TLS CA server was started with a bootstrap identity which has full admin
privileges for the server. One of the key abilities of the admin
is the ability to register new identities. The administrator for this CA will
use the Fabric CA client to register four new identities with the CA, one for
each peer and one for the orderer. These identities will be used to get TLS
certificates for peers and orderers.

You will issue the commands below to enroll the TLS CA admin and then register
identities. We assume the trusted root certificate for the TLS CA has been copied
to ``/tmp/hyperledger/tls-ca/crypto/tls-ca-cert.pem`` on all host machines that
will communicate with this CA via the fabric-ca-client.

.. code:: bash

   export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/tls-ca/crypto/tls-ca-cert.pem
   export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/tls-ca/admin
   fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://tls-ca-admin:tls-ca-adminpw@0.0.0.0:7052
   fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer1-org1 --id.secret peer1PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7052
   fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer2-org1 --id.secret peer2PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7052
   fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer1-org2 --id.secret peer1PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7052
   fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer2-org2 --id.secret peer2PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7052
   fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name orderer1-org0 --id.secret ordererPW --id.type orderer -u https://0.0.0.0:7052

.. note:: If the path of the environment variable FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES is not
          an absolute path, it will be parsed as relative to the client's home directory.

With the identities registered on the TLS CA, we can move forward to setting up the
each organization's network. Anytime we need to get TLS certificates for a node in an
organization, we will refer to this CA.

Setup Orderer Org CA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each organization must have it's own Certificate Authority (CA) for
issuing enrollment certificates. The CA will issue the certificates
for each of the peers and clients in the organization.

Your CA creates the identities that belong to your organization and issue
each identity a public and private key. These keys are what allow all of your
nodes and applications to sign and verify their actions. Any identity signed
by your CA will be understood by other members of the network to identify the
components that belong to your organization.

An administrator for Org0 will launch a Fabric CA docker container, which
will be used by Org0 to issue cryptographic material for identities in Org0.

A docker service such as the one below can be used to a launch a Fabric CA
container.

.. code:: yaml

   rca-org0:
      container_name: rca-org0
      image: hyperledger/fabric-ca
      command: /bin/bash -c 'fabric-ca-server start -d -b rca-org0-admin:rca-org0-adminpw --port 7053'
      environment:
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/fabric-ca/crypto
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_ENABLED=true
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CSR_CN=rca-org0
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CSR_HOSTS=0.0.0.0
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_DEBUG=true
      volumes:
         - /tmp/hyperledger/org0/ca:/tmp/hyperledger/fabric-ca
      networks:
         - fabric-ca
      ports:
         - 7053:7053

On a successful launch of the container, you will see the following line in
the CA container's log.

.. code:: bash

   [INFO] Listening on https://0.0.0.0:7053

At this point the CA server is listening on a secure socket, and can start
issuing cryptographic material.

Enroll Orderer Org's CA Admin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will issue the commands below to enroll the CA admin and then register
both of Org0's identities.

In the commands below, we will assume the trusted root certificate for the CA's
TLS certificate has been copied to
``/tmp/hyperledger/org0/ca/crypto/ca-cert.pem``
on the host machine where the fabric-ca-client binary is present.
If the client binary is located on a different host, you will need to get
the signing certificate through an out-of-band process.

The following identities will be registered:
   - Orderer (orderer1-org0)
   - Orderer admin (admin-org0)

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/ca/crypto/ca-cert.pem
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/ca/admin
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://rca-org0-admin:rca-org0-adminpw@0.0.0.0:7053
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name orderer1-org0 --id.secret ordererpw --id.type orderer -u https://0.0.0.0:7053
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name admin-org0 --id.secret org0adminpw --id.type admin --id.attrs "hf.Registrar.Roles=client,hf.Registrar.Attributes=*,hf.Revoker=true,hf.GenCRL=true,admin=true:ecert,abac.init=true:ecert" -u https://0.0.0.0:7053

The enroll command you executed above, would have populated the
``/tmp/hyperledger/org0/ca/admin`` directory with the cryptographic material
issued form the CA. You will see files such as the ones below:

.. code:: text

   admin
   ├── fabric-ca-client-config.yaml
   └── msp
      ├── IssuerPublicKey
      ├── IssuerRevocationPublicKey
      ├── cacerts
      │   └── 0-0-0-0-7053.pem
      ├── keystore
      │   └── 60b6a16b8b5ba3fc3113c522cce86a724d7eb92d6c3961cfd9afbd27bf11c37f_sk
      ├── signcerts
      │   └── cert.pem
      └── user

The ``fabric-ca-client-config.yaml`` is a file that is generated by the CA client,
this file contains the configuration of the CA client. There are three other important files
to note. First one is ``0-0-0-0-7053.pem``, this is the public certificate of the
CA that issued the certificate for this identity. Second is ``60b6a16b8b5ba3fc3113c522cce86a724d7eb92d6c3961cfd9afbd27bf11c37f_sk``,
this is the private key that was generated by the client. The name of this file
is variable and will be different everytime a key is generated. The last item is ``cert.pem``,
this is the certificate of the admin was that was signed and issued by the CA.

Setup Org1's CA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same set of steps you performed for Org0 apply to Org1's CA.

An administrator for Org1 will launch a Fabric CA docker container, which
will be used by Org1 to issue cryptographic material for identities in Org1.

A docker service, such as the one below can be used to a launch a Fabric CA
container.

.. code:: yaml

   rca-org1:
      container_name: rca-org1
      image: hyperledger/fabric-ca
      command: /bin/bash -c 'fabric-ca-server start -d -b rca-org1-admin:rca-org1-adminpw'
      environment:
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/fabric-ca/crypto
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_ENABLED=true
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CSR_CN=rca-org1
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CSR_HOSTS=0.0.0.0
         - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_DEBUG=true
      volumes:
         - /tmp/hyperledger/org1/ca:/tmp/hyperledger/fabric-ca
      networks:
         - fabric-ca
      ports:
         - 7054:7054

On a successful launch of the container, you will see the following line in
the CA container's log.

.. code:: bash

   [INFO] Listening on https://0.0.0.0:7054

At this point the CA server is listening on a secure socket, and can start
issuing cryptographic material.

Enroll Org1's CA Admin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will issue the commands below to enroll the CA admin and then register
both of Org1's identities.

The following identies are being registered:
   - Peer 1 (peer1-org1)
   - Peer 2 (peer2-org1)
   - Admin (admin1-org1)
   - End user (user-org1)

In the commands below, we will assume the trusted root certificate for the CA's
TLS certificate has been copied to
``/tmp/hyperledger/org1/ca/crypto/ca-cert.pem``
on the host machine where the fabric-ca-client binary is present.
If the client's binary is located on a different host, you will need to get the
signing certificate through an out-of-band process.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/ca/crypto/ca-cert.pem
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/ca/admin
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://rca-org1-admin:rca-org1-adminpw@0.0.0.0:7054
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer1-org1 --id.secret peer1PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7054
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer2-org1 --id.secret peer2PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7054
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name admin-org1 --id.secret org1AdminPW --id.type user -u https://0.0.0.0:7054
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name user-org1 --id.secret org1UserPW --id.type user -u https://0.0.0.0:7054

Setup Org2's CA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same set of steps that you followed for Org1 apply to Org2. So we will quickly
go through the set of steps that the administrator for Org2 will perform.

A docker service, such as the one below can be used to a launch a Fabric CA for
Org2.

.. code:: yaml

  rca-org2:
    container_name: rca-org2
    image: hyperledger/fabric-ca
    command: /bin/bash -c 'fabric-ca-server start -d -b rca-org2-admin:rca-org2-adminpw --port 7055'
    environment:
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/fabric-ca/crypto
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_ENABLED=true
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CSR_CN=rca-org2
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CSR_HOSTS=0.0.0.0
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_DEBUG=true
    volumes:
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org2/ca:/tmp/hyperledger/fabric-ca
    networks:
      - fabric-ca
    ports:
      - 7055:7055

On a successful launch of the container, you will see the following line in
the CA container's log.

.. code:: bash

   [INFO] Listening on https://0.0.0.0:7055

At this point the CA server is listening on a secure socket, and can start
issuing cryptographic material.

Enrolling Org2's CA Admin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will issue the commands below to get the CA admin enrolled and all peer
related identities registered. In the commands below, we will assume the trusted
root certificate of CA's TLS certificate has been copied to
``/tmp/hyperledger/org2/ca/crypto/ca-cert.pem``.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/ca/crypto/ca-cert.pem
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/ca/admin
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://rca-org2-admin:rca-org2-adminpw@0.0.0.0:7055
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer1-org2 --id.secret peer1PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7055
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer2-org2 --id.secret peer2PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7055
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name admin-org2 --id.secret org2AdminPW --id.type user -u https://0.0.0.0:7055
    fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name user-org2 --id.secret org2UserPW --id.type user -u https://0.0.0.0:7055

Setup Peers
-----------------

Once the CAs are up and running, we can start enrolling peers.

Setup Org1's Peers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An administrator for Org1 will enroll the peers with it's CA and then launch the
peer docker containers. Before you can start up a peer, you will need to enroll
the peer identities with the CA to get the MSP that the peer will use.
This is known as the local peer MSP.

Enroll Peer1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the host machine running Peer1 does not have the fabric-ca-client binary,
refer to the instructions above on to download the binary.

In the command below, we will assume the trusted root certificate of Org1 has
been copied to ``/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/ca/org1-ca-cert.pem``
on Peer1's host machine. Acquiring of the signing certificate is an out of
band process.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/ca/org1-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://peer1-org1:peer1PW@0.0.0.0:7054

Next step is to get the TLS cryptographic material for the peer. This requires another enrollment,
but this time you will enroll against the ``tls`` profile on the TLS CA. You will
also need to provide the address of the Peer1's host machine in the enrollment
request as the input to the ``csr.hosts`` flag. In the command below, we will
assume the certificate of the TLS CA has been copied to
``/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem``
on Peer1's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR=tls-msp
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://peer1-org1:peer1PW@0.0.0.0:7052 --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts peer1-org1

Go to path ``/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/tls-msp/keystore`` and change the name of
the key to ``key.pem``. This will make it easy to be able to refer to in
later steps.

At this point, you will have two MSP directories. One MSP contains peer's enrollment
certificate and the other has the peer's TLS certificate. However, there needs to be
an additional folder added in the enrollment MSP directory, and this is the ``admincerts``
folder. This folder will contain certificate(s) for the administrator of Org1.
We will talk more about this when we enroll Org1's admin a little further down.

Enroll Peer2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will perform similar commands for Peer2. In the commands below, we will
assume the trusted root certificate of Org1 has been copied to
``/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer2/assets/ca/org1-ca-cert.pem`` on Peer2's host
machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer2
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer2/assets/ca/org1-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://peer2-org1:peer2PW@0.0.0.0:7054

Next step is to get the TLS cryptographic material for the peer. This requires another enrollment,
but this time you will enroll against the ``tls`` profile on the TLS CA. You will
also need to provide the address of the Peer2's host machine in the enrollment
request as the input to the ``csr.hosts`` flag. In the command below, we will
assume the certificate of the TLS CA has been copied to
``/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer2/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem``
on Peer2's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR=tls-msp
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer2/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://peer2-org1:peer2PW@0.0.0.0:7052 --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts peer2-org1

Go to path ``/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer2/tls-msp/keystore`` and change the name of
the key to ``key.pem``. This will make it easy to be able to refer to in
later steps.

At this point, you will have two MSP directories. One MSP contains peer's enrollment
certificate and the other has the peer's TLS certificate. You will add the
``admincerts`` folder to the enrollment MSP once the admin has been enrolled.

Enroll Org1's Admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, both peers have been enrolled. Now, you will enroll
Org1's admin identity. The admin identity is responsible for activities such as
installing and instantiating chaincode. The steps below will enroll the admin.
The commands below assumes that this is being executed on Peer1's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/ca/org1-ca-cert.pem
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR=msp
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://admin-org1:org1AdminPW@0.0.0.0:7054

After enrollment, you should have an admin MSP. You will copy the
certificate from this MSP and move it to the Peer1's MSP in the ``admincerts``
folder. You will need to disseminate this admin certificate to other peers in the
org, and it will need to go in to the ``admincerts`` folder of each peers' MSP.

The command below is only for Peer1, the exchange of the admin certificate to Peer2 will
happen out-of-band.

.. code:: bash

    mkdir /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/msp/admincerts
    cp /tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/msp/admincerts/org1-admin-cert.pem

If the ``admincerts`` folder is missing from the peer's local MSP, the peer will
fail to start up.

Launch Org1's Peers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once we have enrolled all the peers and org admin, we have the necessary MSPs to
start the peers.

A docker service, such as the one below can be used to a launch a container for
Peer1.

.. code:: yaml

  peer1-org1:
    container_name: peer1-org1
    image: hyperledger/fabric-peer
    environment:
      - CORE_PEER_ID=peer1-org1
      - CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org1:7051

      - /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1:/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1
    networks:
      - fabric-ca

Launching the peer service will bring up a peer container, and in the logs you will
see the following line:

.. code:: bash

   serve -> INFO 020 Started peer with ID=[name:"peer1-org1" ], network ID=[dev], address=[peer1-org1:7051]

A docker service, such as the one below can be used to a launch a container for
Peer2.

.. code:: yaml

  peer2-org1:
    container_name: peer2-org1
    image: hyperledger/fabric-peer

      - /var/run:/host/var/run
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer2:/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer2
    networks:
      - fabric-ca

Launching the peer service will bring up a peer container, and in the logs you
will see the following line:

.. code:: bash

    serve -> INFO 020 Started peer with ID=[name:"peer2-org1" ], network ID=[dev], address=[peer2-org1:7051]

Setup Org2's Peers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An administrator for Org2 will use the CA's bootstrap identity to enroll the peers
with the CA and then launch the peer docker containers.

Enroll Peer1
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will issue the commands below to enroll Peer1. In the commands below,
we will assume the trusted root certificate of Org2 is available at
``/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/assets/ca/org2-ca-cert.pem`` on Peer1's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/assets/ca/org2-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://peer1-org2:peer1PW@0.0.0.0:7055

Next, you will get the TLS certificate. In the command below, we will assume the
certificate of the TLS CA has been copied to ``/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem``
on Peer1's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR=tls-msp
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://peer1-org2:peer1PW@0.0.0.0:7052 --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts peer1-org2

Go to path ``/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/tls-msp/keystore`` and change the name of the
key to ``key.pem``.

Enroll Peer2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will issue the commands below to get Peer2 enrolled. In the commands below,
we will assume the trusted root certificate of Org2 is available at
``/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer2/tls/org2-ca-cert.pem`` on Peer2's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer2
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer2/assets/ca/org2-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://peer2-org2:peer2PW@0.0.0.0:7055

Next, you will get the TLS certificate. In the command below, we will assume the
certificate of the TLS CA has been copied to ``/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer2/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem``
on Peer2's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR=tls-msp
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer2/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://peer2-org2:peer2PW@0.0.0.0:7052 --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts peer2-org2

Go to path ``/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer2/tls-msp/keystore`` and change the name
of the key to ``key.pem``.

Enroll Org2's Admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, you will have two MSP directories. One MSP contains your enrollment
certificate and the other has your TLS certificate. However, there needs be one
additional folder added in the enrollment MSP directory, and this is the ``admincerts``
folder. This folder will contain certificates for the administrator of org2.
You will enroll the org2 admin's identity by issuing the commands below.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/admin
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/tls/org1-ca-cert.pem
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR=msp
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://admin-org2:org2AdminPW@0.0.0.0:7055

After enrollment, you should have an admin MSP. You will copy the certifcate from
this MSP and move it to the peer MSP under the ``admincerts`` folder. The commands
below are only for Peer1, the exchange of admin cert to peer2 will happen out-of-band.

.. code:: bash

    mkdir /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/msp/admincerts
    cp /tmp/hyperledger/org2/admin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/msp/admincerts/org2-admin-cert.pem

If the ``admincerts`` folder is missing from the peer's local MSP, the peer will
fail to start up.

Launch Org2's Peers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once we have enrolled all the peers and admin, we have the necessary MSPs to
start the peers.

A docker service, such as the one below can be used to a launch a container for
the peer1.

.. code:: yaml

  peer1-org2:
    container_name: peer1-org2
    image: hyperledger/fabric-peer
    environment:
      - CORE_PEER_ID=peer1-org2

      - /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1:/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1
    networks:
      - fabric-ca

Launching the peer service will bring up a peer container, and in the logs you
will see the following line:

.. code:: bash

   serve -> INFO 020 Started peer with ID=[name:"peer1-org2" ], network ID=[dev], address=[peer1-org2:7051]

A docker service, such as the one below can be used to a launch a container for
the peer1.

.. code:: yaml

  peer2-org2:
    container_name: peer2-org2
    image: hyperledger/fabric-peer
    environment:
      - CORE_PEER_ID=peer2-org2

      - /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer2:/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer2
    networks:
      - fabric-ca

Launching the peer service will bring up a peer container, and in the logs you
will see the following line:

.. code:: bash

    serve -> INFO 020 Started peer with ID=[name:"peer2-org2" ], network ID=[dev], address=[peer2-org2:7052]

Setup Orderer
---------------

The last thing we need to setup is the orderer. We need to take a couple
of actions before we can start up the orderer.

Enroll Orderer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before starting the orderer, you will need to enroll the orderer's identity with a
CA to get the MSP that the orderer will use. This is known as the local orderer
MSP.

If the host machine does not have the fabric-ca-client binary, please refer to
the instructions above on to download the binary.

You will issue the commands below to get the orderer enrolled. In the commands
below, we will assume the trusted root certificates for Org0 is available in
``/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/assets/ca/org0-ca-cert.pem`` on the orderer's
host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/assets/ca/org0-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://orderer-org0:ordererPW@0.0.0.0:7053

Next, you will get the TLS certificate. In the command below, we will assume the
certificate of the TLS CA has been copied to ``/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem``
on Orderer's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR=tls-msp
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/assets/tls-ca/tls-ca-cert.pem
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://orderer-org0:ordererPW@0.0.0.0:7052 --enrollment.profile tls --csr.hosts orderer1-org0

Go to path ``/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/tls-msp/keystore`` and change the name
of the key to ``key.pem``.

At this point, you will have two MSP directories. One MSP contains your enrollment
certificate and the other has your TLS certificate. However, there needs be one
additional folder added in the enrollment MSP directory, this is the ``admincerts``
folder. This folder will contain certificates for the administrator of peer 1.
Now, you will enroll the Org0's admin identity by issuing the commands below.

Enroll Org0's Admin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The command below assumes that this is being executed on the orderer's host machine.

.. code:: bash

    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/admin
    export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_MSPDIR=msp
    fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://orderer-org0-admin:ordererAdminPW@0.0.0.0:7053

After enrollment, you should have an msp folder at ``/tmp/hyperledger/org0/admin``.
You will copy the certificate from this MSP and move it to the orderer's MSP under the
``admincerts`` folder.

.. code:: bash

    mkdir /tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/msp/admincerts
    cp /tmp/hyperledger/org0/admin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem /tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/msp/admincerts/orderer-admin-cert.pem

Create Genesis Block and Channel Transaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The orderer requires a genesis block that it uses to bootstrap itself.
You can find more information in the `Hyperledger Fabric documentation <https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/configtx.html?channel-configuration-configtx>`_

In documentation below, you'll find a snippet of ``configtx.yaml`` that is written for this
specific deployment. For the full ``configtx.yaml``, click :doc:`here <configtx>`.

On the orderer's host machine, we need to collect the MSPs for all the
organizations. The ``organization`` section in the ``configtx.yaml`` looks like:

.. code:: yaml

   Organizations:

   - &org0

      Name: org0

      ID: org0MSP

      MSPDir: /tmp/hyperledger/org0/msp

   - &org1

      Name: org1

      ID: org1MSP

      MSPDir: /tmp/hyperledger/org1/msp

      AnchorPeers:
         - Host: peer1-org1
            Port: 7051

   - &org2

      Name: org2

      ID: org2MSP

      MSPDir: /tmp/hyperledger/org2/msp

      AnchorPeers:
         - Host: peer1-org2
           Port: 7051

The MSP for Org0 will contain the trusted root certificate of Org0,
the certificate of the Org0's admin identity, and the trusted root certificate of
the TLS CA. The MSP folder structure can be seen below.

.. code:: text

   /tmp/hyperledger/org0/msp
   ├── admincerts
   │   └── admin-org0-cert.pem
   ├── cacerts
   │   └── org0-ca-cert.pem
   ├── tlscacerts
   │   └── tls-ca-cert.pem
   └── users

The pattern is the same for all organization. The MSP folder structure for
Org1 would like:

.. code:: text

   /tmp/hyperledger/org1/msp
   ├── admincerts
   │   └── admin-org1-cert.pem
   ├── cacerts
   │   └── org1-ca-cert.pem
   ├── tlscacerts
   │   └── tls-ca-cert.pem
   └── users

The MSP folder structure for Org2 would like:

.. code:: text

   /tmp/hyperledger/org2/msp
   ├── admincerts
   │   └── admin-org2-cert.pem
   ├── cacerts
   │   └── org2-ca-cert.pem
   ├── tlscacerts
   │   └── tls-ca-cert.pem
   └── users

Once all these MSPs are present on the orderer's host machine you will execute the
following commands from the directory in which ``configtx.yaml`` is present:

.. code:: bash

   configtxgen -profile OrgsOrdererGenesis -outputBlock /tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/genesis.block
   configtxgen -profile OrgsChannel -outputCreateChannelTx /tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/channel.tx -channelID mychannel

This will generate two artifacts, ``genesis.block`` and ``channel.tx``, which will
be used in later steps.

Commands for gathering certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fabric CA client has a couple commands that are useful in acquiring the certificates
for the orderer genesis and peer MSP setup.

The first command is the `fabric-ca-client certificate` command. This command can be used
to get certificates for the admincers folder. For more information on how to use this command
, please refer to: `listing certificate information <https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#listing-certificate-information>`__

The second command is the `fabric-ca-client getcainfo` command. This command can be used to gather
certificates for the `cacerts` and `tlscacerts` folders. The `getcainfo` command returns back the
certificate of the CA.

Mutual TLS
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Endpoints can be secured using Mutual TLS as well. If the CA, Peer, or Orderer are using mutual
TLS then the client must also present a TLS certificate that will be verified by the server.

Mutual TLS requires the client to acquire a TLS certificate that it will present to the server.
Acquiring a TLS certificate can be done via a TLS certificate authority that does have mutual TLS enabled.
Once the client has aquired a TLS certificate, then it can start communication with mutual TLS enabled servers aslong as the trusted TLS authority on the server is the same as issuing authority for the client's TLS certificate.

Launch Orderer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have created the genesis block and the channel transaction, you can
define an orderer service that points to the genesis.block created above.

.. code:: yaml

  orderer1-org0:
    container_name: orderer1-org0
    image: hyperledger/fabric-orderer
    environment:
      - ORDERER_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/orderer
      - ORDERER_HOST=orderer1-org0
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_LISTENADDRESS=0.0.0.0
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISMETHOD=file
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISFILE=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/genesis.block
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_LOCALMSPID=org0MSP
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_LOCALMSPDIR=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/msp
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ENABLED=true
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/tls-msp/signcerts/cert.pem
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_PRIVATEKEY=/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/tls-msp/keystore/key.pem
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ROOTCAS=[/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/tls-msp/tlscacerts/tls-0-0-0-0-7052.pem]
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_LOGLEVEL=debug
      - ORDERER_DEBUG_BROADCASTTRACEDIR=data/logs
    volumes:
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer:/tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/
    networks:
      - fabric-ca

Launching the orderer service will bring up an orderer container, and in the logs
you will see the following line:

.. code:: bash

   UTC [orderer/common/server] Start -> INFO 0b8 Beginning to serve requests

Create CLI Containers
----------------------

Communication with peers requires a CLI container, the container contains the appropriate
binaries that will allow you to issue peer related commands. You will create
a CLI container for each org. In this example, we launch a CLI container
in the same host machine as Peer1 for each org.

Launch Org1's CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: yaml

 cli-org1:
    container_name: cli-org1
    image: hyperledger/fabric-tools
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    environment:
      - GOPATH=/opt/gopath
      - CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock
      - FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=DEBUG
      - CORE_PEER_ID=cli-org1
      - CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org1:7051
      - CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org1MSP
      - CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true
      - CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/tls-msp/tlscacerts/tls-0-0-0-0-7052.pem
      - CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/msp
    working_dir: /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/org1
    command: sh
    volumes:
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1:/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/chaincode:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin:/tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin
    networks:
      - fabric-ca

Launch Org2's CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: yaml

 cli-org2:
    container_name: cli-org2
    image: hyperledger/fabric-tools
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    environment:
      - GOPATH=/opt/gopath
      - CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock
      - FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=DEBUG
      - CORE_PEER_ID=cli-org2
      - CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org2:7051
      - CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org2MSP
      - CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true
      - CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/tls-msp/tlscacerts/tls-0-0-0-0-7052.pem
      - CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/msp
    working_dir: /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/org2
    command: sh
    volumes:
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1:/tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/chaincode:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode
      - /tmp/hyperledger/org2/admin:/tmp/hyperledger/org2/admin
    networks:
      - fabric-ca

Create and Join Channel
------------------------

Org1
^^^^^

With the CLI containers up and running, you can now issue commands to create and
join a channel. We are going to use Peer1 to create the channel. In the
host machine of Peer1, you will execute:

.. code:: bash

   docker exec -it cli-org1 sh

This command will bring you inside the CLI container and open up a terminal. From
here, you will execute the following commands using the admin MSP:

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin/msp
   peer channel create -c mychannel -f /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/channel.tx -o orderer1-org0:7050 --outputBlock /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/mychannel.block --tls --cafile /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/tls-msp/tlscacerts/tls-0-0-0-0-7052.pem

The ``channel.tx`` is an artifact that was generated by running the
``configtxgen`` command on the orderer. This artifact needs to be transferred
to Peer1's host machine out-of-band from the orderer. The command above will generate
``mychannel.block`` on Peer1 at the specified output path ``/tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/mychannel.block``,
which will be used by all peers in the network that wish
to join the channel. This ``mychannel.block`` will be need to transferred to all peers
in both Org1 and Org2 out-of-band.

The next commands you are going to run is to have Peer1 and Peer2 in join
the channel.

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin/msp
   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org1:7051
   peer channel join -b /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/mychannel.block

   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer2-org1:7051
   peer channel join -b /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/assets/mychannel.block

Org2
^^^^^

Run the following command to enter the CLI docker container.

.. code:: bash

   docker exec -it cli-org2 sh

In Org2, you only need to have the peers join the channel. Peers in Org2 do not
need to create the channel, this was already done by Org1. From inside the Org2
CLI container, you will execute the following commands using the admin MSP:

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/admin/msp
   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org2:7051
   peer channel join -b /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/assets/mychannel.block

   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer2-org2:7051
   peer channel join -b /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/assets/mychannel.block


Install and Instantiate Chaincode
----------------------------------

Download this `chaincode <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/chaincode/abac/go>`_
from Github to the local file system on Peer1 in both orgs.

Org1
^^^^^

On Peer1, you are going to install chaincode. The command assumes that the
chaincode that needs to be installed is available inside the GOPATH. In this
example we will assume the chaincode is located at
``/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode/abac/go`` with the
GOPATH being ``/opt/gopath``. From Org1's CLI container, you will
execute the following command:

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org1:7051
   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin/msp
   peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode/abac/go

The same set of steps will be followed for peer2.

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer2-org1:7051
   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin/msp
   peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode/abac/go

Org2
^^^^^

On Peer1, you are going to perform the same steps as Org1. The command
assumes that the chaincode that needs to be installed is available at
``/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/org2/peer1/assets/chaincode/abac/go``.
From Org2's CLI container, you will execute the following command:

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org2:7051
   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/admin/msp
   peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode/abac/go

The same set of steps will be followed for peer2.

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer2-org2:7051
   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/admin/msp
   peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode/abac/go

The next step is going to be to instantiate the chaincode. This done by
executing:

.. code:: bash

   peer chaincode instantiate -C mychannel -n mycc -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["init","a","100","b","200"]}' -o orderer1-org0:7050 --tls --cafile /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/tls-msp/tlscacerts/tls-0-0-0-0-7052.pem

Invoke and Query Chaincode
----------------------------------

From Org1's CLI container, execute:

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org1:7051
   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin/msp
   peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{"Args":["query","a"]}'

This should return a value of ``100``.

From Org2's CLI container, execute:

.. code:: bash

   export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org2:7051
   export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org2/admin/msp
   peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{"Args":["invoke","a","b","10"]}' --tls --cafile /tmp/hyperledger/org2/peer1/tls-msp/tlscacerts/tls-0-0-0-0-7052.pem

This is going to subtract 10 from value of ``a`` and move it to ``b``. Now, if
you query by running:

.. code:: bash

   peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{"Args":["query","a"]}'

This should return a value of ``90``.

This concludes the Operations Guide for Fabric CA.
