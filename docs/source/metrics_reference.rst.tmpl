Metrics Reference
=================

Metrics exposed by the Fabric CA include *labels* to differentiate various
characteristics of the item being measured. Five different labels are used.

  api_name
    For API requests, this is the path of the requested resource with the version
    prefix removed. The list of resource paths can be found in the
    `Swagger API Documentation <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/master/swagger/swagger-fabric-ca.json>`_.
    Examples include ``cainfo``, register``, and ``enroll``.

  ca_name
    The name of the certificate authority associated with the metric.

  db_api_name
    For database requests, this contains the SQL operation that was used.
    Examples include ``Commit``, ``Exec``, ``Get``, ``NamedExec``, ``Select``,
    and ``Queryx``

  func_name
    For database access, this includes the name of the function that initiated
    the database request. Examples include ``GetUser``, ``InsertUser``,
    ``LoginComplete``, and  ``ResetIncorrectLoginAttempts``.

  status_code
    For API requests, this is the HTTP status code of the response. Successful
    requests will have status codes that are less than 400.
