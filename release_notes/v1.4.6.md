v1.4.6 Release Notes - February 25, 2020
========================================

Fixes
-----

- **fabric-ca-server provided binary only works on linux-amd64**

  v1.4.5 added fabric-ca-server binary to the downloadable release artifacts.
  However, the binary only works on linux-amd64 platform due to cross-compilation
  issues. v1.4.6 therefore delivers fabric-ca-server binary for linux-amd64
  platform only. Users may compile fabric-ca-server binary themselves on
  their own platform however.

Changes, Known Issues, and Workarounds
--------------------------------------

None.

Known Vulnerabilities
---------------------
- FABC-174 Commands can be manipulated to delete identities or affiliations

  This vulnerability can be resolved in one of two ways:

  1) Use HTTPS (TLS) so that the authorization header is not in clear text.

  2) The token generation/authentication mechanism was improved to optionally prevent
  token reuse. In v1.4 a more secure token can be used by setting environment variable:

  FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false

  However, it cannot be set to false until all clients have
  been updated to generate the more secure token and tolerate
  FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false.
  The Fabric CA client has been updated in v1.4 to generate the more secure token.
  The Fabric SDKs will be updated by v2.0 timeframe to generate the more secure token,
  at which time the default for Fabric CA server will change to:
  FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false

Resolved Vulnerabilities
------------------------
None.
