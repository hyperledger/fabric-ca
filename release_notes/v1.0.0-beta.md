## Resolved Vulnerabilities

[FAB-4372](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4372) The current logic only checked to see if an identity has a specific attribute. There was no check being made as to the actual value of the attribute. This was allowing certain execution of code that should have been prevented if the attribute had a value of false. For example, I can start a root server and register an identity with "hf.IntermediateCA=false", however I am still able to register this identity as an intermediate CA.
