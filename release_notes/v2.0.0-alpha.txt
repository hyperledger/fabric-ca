v2.0.0-alpha Release Notes - April 9, 2019
------------------------------------------

What's New in Hyperledger Fabric CA v2.0
----------------------------------------

FABC-408 Add support for CORS
CORS can be enabled in Fabric CA server using new server flags:
--cors.enabled   Enable CORS for the fabric-ca-server
--cors.origins   Comma-separated list of Access-Control-Allow-Origin domains

FABC-735 - Docker images with Alpine Linux
Hyperledger Fabric CA Docker image will now use Alpine Linux,
a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution.

FABC-782
Fabric CA API operational metrics

FABC-789

Changes, Known Issues, and Workarounds
--------------------------------------

FAB-11096 - Docker images with Alpine Linux
Bash is no longer available in Fabric images. Utilize Alpine's built-in
sh or ash instead.


Known Vulnerabilities
---------------------
FABC-174 Commands can be manipulated to delete identities or affiliations

This vulnerability can be resolved in one of two ways:

1) Use HTTPS (TLS) so that the authorization header is not in clear text.

2) The token generation/authentication mechanism was improved to optionally prevent
token reuse. In v1.4 a more secure token can be used by setting environment variable:

FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false

However, it cannot be set to false until all clients have
been updated to generate the more secure token and tolerate
FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false.
The Fabric CA client has been updated in v1.4 to generate the more secure token.
The Fabric SDKs will be updated by v2.0 timeframe to generate the more secure token,
at which time the default for Fabric CA server will change to:
FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false

Resolved Vulnerabilities
------------------------
None.
