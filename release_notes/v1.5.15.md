v1.5.15 Release Notes - February 7, 2025
========================================

v1.5.15 adds logging of Fabric CA server configuration upon startup,
as well as the configuration for `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3`
to assist with the change mentioned below that was delivered in v1.5.14.


Dependencies
------------

Fabric CA v1.5.15 has been tested with the following dependencies:
- Go 1.23.5
- Ubuntu 22.04 (for Docker images)
- Databases
    - PostgreSQL 13
    - MySQL 8.0


Changes
-------

In Fabric CA v1.4 a more secure mechanism was made available for authentication.
Most Fabric CA clients have been updated to utilize the new authentication header,
therefore Fabric CA v1.5.14 changes the default to utilize the more secure mechanism.
If you have an older Fabric CA client you can still utilize the prior mechanism by
setting the following environment variable on the Fabric CA server:

`FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=true`

Known Vulnerabilities
