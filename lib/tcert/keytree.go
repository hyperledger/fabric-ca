/*
 * A key tree is a hierarchy of derived keys with a single root key.
 * Each node in the tree has a key and a name, where the key is secret
 * and the name may be public.  If the secret associated with a node
 * is known, then the secret of each node in it's sub-tree can be derived
 * if the name of the nodes are known; however, it is not possible to
 * derive the keys associated with other nodes in the tree which are not
 * part of this sub-tree.
 *
 * This data structure is useful to support releasing a secret associated
 * with any node to an auditor without giving the auditor access to all
 * nodes in the tree.
